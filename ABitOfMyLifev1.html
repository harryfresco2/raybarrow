    <p class="c8"><span class="c9 c2">I decided to write this journal today as in 2018, I was diagnosed with Vascular
            Dementia. This is short term memory loss. I can remember most of the past, but short term I forget what has
            happened the day before. Things like films I can not remember at all. Every so often, I would be watching a
            film and Pam would tell me that I had seen the film before. I would have no knowledge of this, also I can
            get half way through a sentence and forget what I am talking about. I am unable to read books because as
            soon as I get to the end of a chapter, I forget the contents that I have just read. This gets frustrating
            for both myself and Pam, so I am writing this whilst I am able to. I can tell you this, that all that I am
            writing is the truth, the whole truth, so help me God. This is written in words that I use myself, there are
            no substitute words. The punctuation has not been changed, most of the spelling has been checked with the
            spellcheck on the Mac, the grammar is how it is, so as you read this you may have a good laugh at the way
            it&rsquo;s written. You may find that some dates are mixed about a bit, some times of events in the article
            should be in different places, all the photos are listed in the last page. I hope this is interesting.
            It&rsquo;s a bit about my life, any dodgy stuff has been left out (if there was any). &nbsp;</span></p>

    <h1 class="c19 c5" id="h.jznduvkcx3tu"><span>Meeting my Mum &amp; Dad</span></h1>
    <p class="c19"><span class="c2">I first met my mum in 1942. I was born in a top floor apartment, in Kier Hardie
            House, Hazellville Road, a large block of flats at the top of Crouch End Road, North London. This is where
            we lived with three elder brothers and one younger sister, who was born in Liverpool. John was the oldest
            out of us all. He was born in 1936. Next came Fred, 1938 and Bil, &nbsp;1939 (they were born in Blundell St,
            North London). My Dad was a professional soldier in the Army. He was in the Royal Fusiliers. Then, because
            of his railway knowledge, was transferred to the Royal Engineers. He worked on the railways in France and
            Germany in the 2nd World War. I can only remember one thing whilst we lived there, that is when I was about
            three years old, my mum took me outside to see what she said were fireworks. They were, in fact, the bombs
            being dropped on London. As we lived at the top of the block of flats we had a view of the whole of London
            being bombed, I could see houses and buildings on fire, I can still remember it today. (</span><span
            class="c6 c2">Silly war joke: If women ruled the world there would be no war, just a bunch of countries not
            talking to each other.)</span></p>

    <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was about 1946 when we moved to 84 Hornsey Road, North London. I was four years
            old and we lived in a three storey house that was owned by a film star.</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c2">His name was Arthur Mullard. He had the first two floors and we
            had the top floor and the attic. The toilet was downstairs in the garden. I can remember sleeping in the
            attic with lots of coats on the bed for blankets. We had the water tank up there and my dad put fish inside
            the tank. I remember him saying to me that they keep the water clean for us to drink. It was in 84 Hornsey
            Road that my younger brother was born. His name was Jimmy. I remember that sometimes mum would let me feed
            him, holding the bottle. In 1947 he died of Whooping Cough, he was only 18 months old. In those days, of
            course, there was no NHS. That did not start &lsquo;til 1948. I can remember at the end of our back garden
            were railway lines, and trains would come by with American soldiers on it, and as I was only about four they
            would throw money for me. This was probably my first venture into business because I would go out most days
            to catch the coins, then give them to my mum who would buy cakes for us. </span></p>

    <p class="c8"><span class="c9 c2">We had lots of fun in those days, I would play on the railway lines with my
            brothers, we would play on the bomb sites, and go scrumping. I can remember we would bunk in cinemas (go in
            the back door that was left open most days), then have the cheek to go up into the balcony and pick the best

            in there for a few hours, we did not have any heating in our house, or hot running water. This had to be
            boiled in a kettle. We would go to the swimming baths to wash and bathe, not far from 84. </span></p>

            school when I was five and can remember that the teacher would make us stand in line and she would give
            every child a teaspoon of malt. She gave a spoonful to one child, then put the spoon in the jar and fed the

    <p class="c8"><span class="c9 c2">I can remember that my dad came home from the Army one day, and said that he will
            be home to stay now because he had resigned from the army. He did this knowing that he was only just a few
            weeks away from getting his pension. He was a Sergeant and one story he told us was when he led a small
            platoon onto the beach, whilst he was at Dunkirk. It was here that the Germans were bombing. One of his
            group had gone AWOL and Dad had to go back and get him. Whilst he was looking for him, his whole platoon had
            been killed by a German bomb. How lucky was he?</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c9 c2">I was very proud of my dad. He could make and build anything. He took a motorbike
            engine to bits and put it all back with new parts, without an instruction book. When we were at Hainault, he
            taught me how to do woodwork and lots of different things that a handyman can do. Sadly, I was not very good
            at this, and later in life Pam is the person that does most of this at our home. He brought a Grandfather
            clock home from Germany. It was all in pieces in his kit bag, then he assembled it and that stayed in the
            hall in our new home to be, in Hainault. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Hainault was one of a few council estates that were going up fast in Essex, and if
            you worked in the area you were eligible for a council house, so we were on our way to a much cleaner part
            of England. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">If I can remember, we put what furniture we had onto a lorry and off we went to our
            new home. This was a three bed home that had just been built. This had a bathroom with hot water and a bath,
            our own kitchen, a back and front garden. To us kids it was just like we had gone to heaven (by the way, I
            now had a sister to annoy every day, Pat. She was born in 1944 in Liverpool, so she was two years younger
            than me). There were more to come yet, another three; two sisters and one brother. We lived at 2 Burrow
            Close, Chigwell, Essex </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Essex joke: How do you confuse an Essex girl? You
            don&#39;t. They&#39;re born that way.) </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Burrow Close soon filled up with other families and soon we were making new
            friends to play with. I was now six and three quarter years old. I used to have to go by coach to school,
            about five miles away, because the schools in Hainault weren&rsquo;t built yet, but soon the local school
            opened up and off we went. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">My teacher, Miss Townsend, used to put her sandwiches on my desk for me to eat
            because she knew that I got little food at home. She was a lovely teacher and I wished that I could have met
            later in life to thank her. I did not like school much, later when we got to senior school I would miss
            school and bunk off. I then went off the rail a bit and started thinking of easy ways to earn money. My dad
            and I would go to Hainault Forest and dig the leaf mould up and sieve it, then put it in an old pram that we
            had, and he would spread it over the garden. Leaf mould was good for plants. I said to him that if I could
            use the pram I could sell this to people. This was the start of my first business. My first customer was my
            School teacher, Mr Neville. I would sell this to him for two shillings a load. He would take as much as I
            could get, his wife would give me a cup of tea and cake as well. Mr Neville was a very strict teacher, a bit
            of a bully in some ways because he would hit you with a wooden ruler for the least bit of noise you made in
            class. As I was now best mates with him, he always walked right past me. Word soon got around and after
            school nearly every night I would pick up two loads each day and sell them (the only problem was that I
            would spend the money on cakes). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">My next adventure was doorstep cleaning. I had seen my brother Bill do this, so I
            thought I would try. I would buy red tile polish and clean the front steps of houses for two shillings a
            house. Most women would like to have a nice clean door step, so with a bit of cold calling I was on my way
            to building a good business. I soon built up a cleaning round. With the money from this I would go to jumble
            sales and buy clothes for myself. I was about ten and a half years old now. It was good growing up in a big
            family because there was always something going on. I did not see much of my elder brother, John, because he
            joined the RAF when he was seventeen. So the only time I saw him was if he came home on leave.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Brother Fred was the 2nd oldest. He can remember most things back at 84 to Hornsey
            Rd and would tell me of the street fights that went on.There were two gangs, one on each side of Hornsey
            Road (this is the road that Arsenal football club is on. In fact, The Emirates Stadium which was built later
            years was only 2 minutes away from 84 Hornsey Rd, just on the other side of the railway lines.) Fred was
            really good to us in those days, he would take Bill and myself scrumping (well, we had to eat something). We
            would get very hungry some days. Never saw much of John, he was friendly with Arthur Mullard&rsquo;s
            daughter, Barbra. Don&rsquo;t know what they used to get up to? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Later, when we moved to Hainault, I would stick mainly with my brother Bill and his
            friend Dave Ince. He was two years older than me so I would go around with him and his friends that were
            older. This was good because when I started senior school all the bullies kept their distance. They would
            have to face them if they gave me trouble. In the 1950s there was lots of bullying going on in schools,
            there would be a fight after school nearly every day at our School (Grange County Sec Modern). Noel
            Edmund&rsquo;s father was Headmaster at this school, prior to me going to the school. I can remember one day
            I heard someone say, keep away from Ray Barrow he has two brothers in the school. As in most schools there
            were bike sheds to go to if you wanted a cigarette.</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;(Silly School joke: What

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was in Senior school and when I was about 12 years old, I decided to run away from
            home with a mate of mine, Micky. We managed to get on a train at Ilford, we had decided to go and live in
            Southend-on-sea. We managed to get there without paying, and now it was time to go and look for somewhere to
            stay for the night. We walked across the beach and we thought that one of the beach huts would be good for
            the night. We managed to open one and there were our beds for the night, two beach chairs. We went in and
            settled down for the night. Well, half way through the night, I was so cold. We had no blankets, so we had
            to put up with it. In the morning, we were hungry, we had no money, so I said to </span><span
            class="c2">Micky</span><span class="c9 c2">, if we follow the milkman and he left any goods on a doorstep,
            we would have them away. Our luck was in, two bottles of milk, a fruit loaf and also some buns were left on
            a step, Micky kept look out and, after a few moments, I had picked the goods up and we were on our toes, got
            to the local park and ate the lot. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">We walked around Southend town. Then I began to realise that we would have to find
            a new home for the night, and then I thought it would be cold that night so I said to Micky, I would like to
            go back home. He felt the same. We got to Southend station and got on the platform when a guard spotted us.
            I said, &ldquo;Quick, run Micky&rdquo;, but there was nowhere to go. He took us back to his office and made
            us a cup of hot tea and made us some toast. He did say to us that he would have to inform the police, but I
            thought as he had fed us, that he would let us go, no such luck. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">They got in touch with my Dad and he was on the way to pick me up. I thought it
            was bad enough running away, but to have the police informed, I was in big trouble. My dad arrived with my
            elder brother Bill. Dad said, &ldquo;Why did you run away, son?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,
            I&rsquo;m sorry dad&rdquo;, but he seemed ok about it. I suppose that he was glad that he had found
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Micky&rsquo;s mum came and picked him up. My dad said that I was not allowed out
            for two weeks. It hadn&rsquo;t finished yet. When I got to school the next day the headmaster wanted to see
            us. I went to his office and he pointed out that we had let the school down and out came the cane. I can
            still remember the pain in my mind now, I would never run away again. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I started smoking when I was 10 years old, addicted by 12. By the time I left school
            I was smoking 10 fags a day. Good job I had my leaf mould and doorstep cleaning round to fund this. My dad
            would have gone mad if he knew that I smoked. I can remember my dad coming home from work one day and I was
            sitting indoors having a fag, reading the Dandy, when he walked in the room. I froze, then put the fag under
            the comic and said hello to him. Lucky for me, he went straight into the kitchen and I ran upstairs, put the
            cigarette down the toilet then pulled the chain </span><span class="c6 c2">(The chain I hear you say!! What
            is that? Ask Dad kids, he will know).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I remember whilst I lived at Burrow Close, Bobby Goodyear, a friend who lived
            opposite me, came home with a small sailing boat and asked me if I would like to go sailing with him. I said
            yes and then we were on our way, in his van, with boat in tow to Mayland in Essex to try the boat out. I did
            not know that he had never sailed before and I had no idea what we had to do. Anyhow, we managed to get the
            boat out to sea. We started to drift into the middle of the sea when we </span><span
            class="c2">realised</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;that we could not get the boat back to shore, so we had
            to get out and swim with the boat back to shore. After about two hours we managed to get the boat out of the
            water. We were soaking wet and freezing cold, and the boat was about a mile away from Bobby&rsquo;s van.
            Luckily, a man had seen what had happened and came over and said he would take us back to Bobby&rsquo;s van,
            so we got in his car, soaking wet, and he drove us back. I was so cold, as soon as we got in Bobby&rsquo;s
            van he put the heater on. Then we had to drive back to pick the boat up (I think Bobby now knows how to tack
            when sailing). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The same thing happened when we were on holiday on the Isle of Wight when Pam&rsquo;s
            brother, Laurence, took our son Dave, and his friend Steven, out on a sailing boat and got stuck in the
            middle of the water. Lucky for him the lifeboat crew were at hand to tow the boat back to shore.
        </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly boat joke: What did the boat say when he was not feeling well? I need to go to
            the dock).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">About this time, my Dad, who was now promoted to the breakdown gang (which was a
            team of about 10 men) worked at the Railway yard in Hainault. They had to go out to train-crash sites and
            their job was to get the train back on the railway line so that the rest of the trains on that track could
            keep going. One of these breakdowns was in 1975 at Moorgate station, where 43 people died and 74 injured in
            this crash. This must have brought bad memories back for my dad because of Dunkirk and Belson, where he had
            seen lots of dead bodies. A few days later, he took me to the Depot at Hainault to look at the front of the
            damaged train. It was not a very pleasant site to see, the front carriage was all mangled up. &nbsp;</span>

            not speak. </span></p>

            because she had to pay a little bit extra to get her into a good home. Although Mum could not speak, she
            still knew what was being said. I remember I would go and see her and, one day, I said to her that I would
            water the pot plants, (that were plastic,) she shouted &lsquo;ka ka&rsquo;, which was her word for no no.
            Pam and I laughed. I would also take a teddy bear that was in the room and hang it from the light, because
            Mary was going to pay a visit later and this would make her laugh. We used to pick mum up from the home and
            take her home to Epping for the day. </span></p>

            took her to Tina&rsquo;s house in Hainault for the day, and she loved it. One day, I was playing a tape of
            Cliff Richard and she started to sing. We could not believe it, she could not talk but could sing. She
            passed away a couple of years later. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I got the call from Pete. Pam and I rushed to the Hospital but missed saying
            goodbye, we were twenty minutes late. We were living in Clacton at the time and the A12 had bad roadworks on
            it and the speed was 40 miles an hour all the way. Mary looked after her and did all the paperwork that had
            to be done. She is with Dad now at Chigwell.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">As I have said previously, I have three older brothers. My eldest is John, born
            1936. He was married to Trish (who has sadly passed away) and they had two children, Denise and Karen. I did
            not see much of John because, as I said earlier in the book, he signed up to join the RAF when he was 17. He
            always said that he did this so that he could have his own bed. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I remember that his first job was laying floor tiles. We would only be seeing John
            occasionally, when he came home on leave. Fred was next, he was born 1938. I remember he joined the Army
            when he was 18, serving National Service. When he came home he worked for a packing company that would make
            big boxes out of wood for packing large items. Fred&rsquo;s wife, Irene, who came from Hainault (not far
            from Burrow Close) has two children, Steven and Jackie. Bill was born in 1939. Bill was married to Brenda
            and had three children. Trudy, who passed away in 2023 (she had heart problems), was the eldest child
            followed by Janet then John. They are all great kids. Brenda has since passed away. She would have been the
            same age as me, 81 years old, and like all our family would do anything for each other. Bill was the
            comedian of the family and by far the funniest out of all the Barrows. He would have you in stitches the
            things he would do, sadly passed a few years ago with a heart attack. &nbsp;</span><span

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was fourteen years old when I cycled up to the Bald Hind Garage in Chigwell and
            asked for a job. As I was about to leave school, the boss asked me if the school had sent me up to apply for
            the job. I told him that it was my idea, he admired me for having the courage to come to him without any
            reference from the school. He said </span><span class="c2">start</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;on Monday
            8AM, wages &pound;2.00 a week. I could not wait to start and arrived one hour early. They wanted to see how
            bright I was (Pam said they will have their work cut out there then), so they gave me lots of different jobs
            to do, to find out what I would be any good at. This was from cleaning cars, serving petrol, or in the
            greasing bay servicing cars. The one I liked was serving petrol because lots of wealthy people came into
            this garage, Bobby Moore the footballer was one, and they would give me tips. It was the servicing cars that
            they wanted me to do. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">After a short time, they transferred me to their other garage at Grange Hill,
            Chigwell, opposite the home of Bobby Moore the footballer. They had me serving on the petrol pumps. This was
            a good job because during the lunch hour, I had the garage to myself and would drive the customers&#39; cars
            around the small site, to get used to driving. This was my first learning curve into learning how to drive.
            One day I had the surprise of my life when my best friend from school, Terry Corrie drove past in his
            dad&rsquo;s car (he was only 15 years old, the same as me). I thought to myself his dad would go mad if he
            saw him. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">One day as I started to serve some petrol, the pump started on 2 gallons already
            shown on the pump. This should have gone back to zero. I then thought, when the coal trucks come into the
            garage for fuel, I would start it on two and make two gallons worth eight shillings for myself. I should
            have reported the faulty machine to my boss, but I accidentally forgot, and would start it on two gallons
            every time a coal truck came in for petrol. One good thing about the pumps at this garage is they did not
            have any smelly diesel pumps. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">About this time I had my first crush, this girl would come past the garage every day
            on a horse, she worked at a local farm and looked after the horses. She was the most beautiful girl that I
            had ever seen, she was older than me I think. As she went by, she would give me a smile, but I was too shy
            to approach her. Anyway, I was punching well above my weight there. It was three years after this that I was
            to meet someone even better, my future wife Pam, who I have had a crush on ever since. &nbsp;</span><span
            class="c7 c2">(You can take your fingers out your mouth now readers)</span><span class="c9 c2">. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was </span><span class="c2">now coming up</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;to
            sixteen and able to drive a motorbike, so with some money that I saved from tips, bought a moped from one of
            the customers at the garage. I got my provisional licence, L plates on and I was driving all around Chigwell
            pleased as punch. Coming up to my 17th birthday, the garage had a driving school, so my boss said I could
            have driving lessons in work time. So not only did I not have to pay for lessons, I was taking them in their
            time. After about 12 lessons they sorted me out for a driving test, well me being what I am, passed first
            time. (By the way, I managed to pass my motorbike licence the day before). Now, my job at the garage was
            delivering customers&#39; cars back to them. Remember, I was working in Chigwell so most of the cars I would
            be driving were top of the range cars. Sunbeam Rapier, Humber Hawk, E Type Jaguar and different sports cars,
            (I&rsquo;m getting paid for driving these flash cars). I soon got used to driving all different types, also
            the other job I had was going out getting spare parts for the cars that were in for repair. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">My next venture was to save up for a car. To get funds for the car, I purchased a
            scooter that had been damaged in a crash, my sister in law&rsquo;s brother Roger repaired this for me. I
            part exchanged it and with the cash I had saved, brought a 1961 Morris Minor 1000 registration number
            &lsquo;389 KMU&rsquo;. Now, this meant that I was able to go anywhere. I would take Mum and &nbsp;Dad to see
            brother John who was now in the RAF, wherever he was based at the time, sometimes he was at Doncaster. As I
            was the only one with a car in the family, at the moment, Dad always wanted me to be his taxi. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">When I was seventeen, I started going out to our local youth club with a friend to
            dance halls. At the Ilford Palais and Tottenham Royal, there used to be lots of fights at the Royal, we had
            to make sure that we kept well away from some of the groups. The Kray twins would use the Royal sometimes,
            although I never saw them, I can still remember the band at the Royal. Jeff Rowena was the band leader and
            singer. I would watch the bands that used to play. My friend, Paul (I call him Paul because that is his
            name) was more interested in talking to girls and taking them out. I was not the clever one to chat up girls
            like he could. Paul was the best looking out of the two of us. I was more interested in the bands and
            groups. I was keen on music, and at school was top student, being able to play violin (Passed grade 3 of the
            Royal Schools of Music for this) and also had a go at the cello and viola, but now it was the guitar that I
            was interested in. I would just stare and watch the band all night long.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was now eighteen and a friend that used to come into the garage, told me about this
            job that was going over Fairlop Ballast Pit with the P T Read Company. It was working in the canteen, all I
            had to do was make about 40 cups of tea for the workers three times a day. Well, the wages were eight
            shillings an hour, eight hours a day five days a week which came to mega bucks. This w</span><span
            class="c2">as</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for making 40 cups of tea. With overtime it was three times the
            money I was getting from the Garage. This job gave me lots of free time while I was at the ballast pit, so I
            bought a gun from a friend, it was a twelve bore shotgun, along with some cartridges. I would go over the
            field shooting Rabbits. The company was based at Fairlop Aerodrome, we used to play over the aerodrome when
            I was younger. It was not used any more by the RAF, they left a lot of radio equipment in the bunkers there.
            It was then used by the public, to fly model aircraft, these would be on at the weekends. We would go and
            watch them. It is now called Fairlop Waters. The rabbits that I had shot, used to have loads of pellets in
            them so I did not take them home for mum to cook because she would have wanted to know how I came by these.
            (My dad would never have let me have a gun at home because of the four younger children at home). I used to
            hide the gun in the canteen where I made the tea for the workers, one day I went to get it out and it had
            gone, someone had stolen it.</span><span class="c7 c2">&nbsp;(Silly gun joke,,I buy all my guns from a guy

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">My first true love came when my friend at the garage wanted to fix me up with a blind
            date. I never had many girl friends, in fact you could count them on one hand (this where you go
            &lsquo;ahh!&rsquo;). However, he knew that I was shy, so sorted it for me. She was waiting in Pyrles Lane,
            Loughton, by the telephone box, her name was Pam (I call her this because this is her name). Wow, I liked
            her straight away. She looked at me and gave me as you all know one of her great smiles. (Pam is famous for
            her smiles, I have had lots of people tell me this. At the garage, they would always refer to her as
            &lsquo;smiler&rsquo;). I was so pleased to meet Pam and I was glad that I would not have to look after any
            horses? (think about it). My nickname for Pam is funny face, her nickname for me is the whale (I&rsquo;m
            only 12 stone). We have had so much fun in our lives and now have two great kids and six grandkids (that all

            new red guitar). She then gave me one of those smiles. Pam is the best thing in mine and everyone who knows
            her&rsquo;s life. She is so friendly and loves talking and helping other people. When I was teaching Karate,
            she managed the desk, looking after every student and parent that stood in front of her. Pam&rsquo;s
            customer relationship was top notch. She went out of her way to make herself have good job satisfaction.
            Sometimes after teaching a session, when leaving, all I wanted to do was to get home, have tea and relax.
            Pam would be hard to get into the car because often she would be talking to a student or parent. Pam would
            always drive us home after work because she knew that I would be worn out and tired. She is the better
            driver out of the two of us, she actually drives faster than me. She will do 70mph on a motorway, where I
            drive at 50mph. If I drive home I will drive a bit faster then, but going to wherever we go, normally 50mph.

            near Matching Green in Essex. It was not being used, so we were able to start Pam on driving lessons. She
            was so good, it only took about two hours for her to get the basic idea of driving. Pam love&rsquo;s
            driving, she wanted to go there more often, after a week or so it was time to let her go by herself. I would
            get out of the car and she would drive around the Airfield by herself, round and around. After a couple of

            so as she went round the roundabout, a car came on the right side of her, making Pam pull to the left. I

            things about her, I think that I will be in her good books for a long time). In the early 70s, we bought a
            caravan, and after I finished work on a Friday. Pam would have the van loaded up with supplies and off we
            go. Clacton was a favourite, along with the South Coast, we would go away till Sunday night. The kids loved
            these trips and so did we. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">We used to go to the coast in the summer in my Morris 1000 and would go to the
            pictures. (Today, you call it the cinema). We would sit in the car at the end of night planning all the
            things that we were going to do in our life. Life was so different in the 60s, there were no places to eat
            like there are now. Wimpy Bar came to the UK in the mid 50s, Kentucky Fried Chicken in the 70s. The first
            carvery we went to was the Blue Boar in Abridge. Other than that there weren&rsquo;t many places to eat. I
            remember when I worked in London I would bring pie and mash in to eat on Friday, not forgetting half a
            chicken for our dog. We were living in Wanstead at the time. </span></p>

            You could go to London and park easily, plus it was free. (Parking metres had just started to come out). We
            would go to theatres in the afternoon and get student rates for the shows. It was very cheap, not like the
            prices nowadays. We were on our way to the cinema one day, I drove in the car park and got out of the car
            when I could hear a shout of &ldquo;Ray! Ray!&rdquo;. It was Pam, she had opened the passenger door and fell
            down the bottom of some steps, she came up not too happy and because she had laddered her stockings. She
            wanted to go home. I said to her if we go in when the film starts it would be dark, and no one would notice
            her torn tights. I brought some Maltesers to </span><span class="c2">eat in there</span><span

            shown on the screen. instead of one that you get nowadays). It was pitch black inside the cinema (most films
            were in black and white). It was really dark, you could not see </span><span class="c2">a thing</span><span
            class="c2">. We stumbled in and sat down in the seats. After a while you started to be able to see a bit
            better, we noticed that we were sitting, not in chairs, but in the aisle on the floor. People were looking
            at us sitting down, they had got used to the dark because they had arrived before us. We were so
            embarrassed, we started giggling which turned in loud laughter. So we went up to the back of the cinema
            where no one could see us and started to eat our box of Maltesers. &nbsp;I dropped the box and they fell out
            making their way down the aisle going flop flop all the way down, to the bottom of the stairs. That was it.
            Giggle time again. I think we left the film a bit early so the people would not see us. We laughed so much
            that day. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly cinema joke: I just heard Back to the Future was getting a

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I can remember one night, we went to the cinema, we parked in the cinema car park.
            The cinema was called the State Cinema. It was in Barkingside, the car park was used by the people that were
            inside using the cinema and the bingo hall. I parked in an allocated space and when we came out after the
            film had finished, someone had parked their car in front of mine blocking us in. I went inside and reported
            this to the manager and he put an announcement out for the person to come and move their car. Half an hour
            later we were still waiting, when the lady arrived to move her car, I explained that she should not have
            blocked me in, also why the long time getting here to move it. She said she was not going to miss any of her
            bingo, and we could wait. I explained that she should not have left it there in the first place. By now I
            was getting the ump, (posh people call this word Hump). I left it there and made a note of her car
            registration. I said to Pam we will come here next week same day, same time and I will make her late home
            that night. We got there the following week and I saw her car parked in the car park. I said to Pam to keep
            lookout for me, I went over and let all four tyre&rsquo;s down. It&#39;s not worth doing just one because
            she could change one tire, (but not four). We then sat there and waited when she came out and saw her flat
            tyres. She must have known it was me, but did not know who I was. I had taken her number but she did not
            know mine, (I can be nasty sometimes). I don&rsquo;t think she will block anyone in again. Remember, CCTV
            had not been invented in those days, so you could get away with murder. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly

            talking to my old boss one day and told him about a guitar I had seen in a shop in Romford for &pound;30.
            This was a Watkins Rapier electric guitar (I saw one of these on ebay recently, for &pound;650). I did not
            have any money because I had just spent every penny on the car. He said he would finance it for me and take
            the money out of my wages each week. He was a good boss, I think I was his favourite because when they were
            short staff on the petrol pumps, I would always offer to stand in for extra wages. </span><span

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Pam and I would go out most nights, to a pub in Leytonstone High Rd called the Red
            Lion and watch the pop groups. I learned so much from watching these bands and knew that I would soon be
            playing in one. I tore my fingers to pieces practising my guitar, three hours a night each day of the week,
            then over to Loughton to see Pam. In ten weeks I had got some other members to play and we formed a band
            called the Ravens, we were playing all Shadows music with taking turns playing lead and rhythm. &nbsp;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">A friend that I worked with said that his brother in law Dave wanted to start a
            band. I met Dave. He played rhythm and I played lead (with about four chords between us, we were off). We
            found another guitar player who was able to get the chords of songs, (there was no internet or YouTube in
            those days so you could not get the chords to songs, we had to work them out between us). I would play the
            lead by ear (Not with my ears kids, that is a term for saying you play with no written music). Then we found
            a bass player that had the works, big amplifier, echo unit and lots more stuff, but could not play a note.
            We helped him along to get him going. My brother Bill played the drums. We had about twelve numbers within a
            few weeks, then I managed to get us a guest spot in a club in Chigwell. It went down really well. Pam and
            her Mum came along, her mum used to love listening to us playing, then I fixed us in to play in a pub in
            Buckhurst Hill called the Mother Hubbard.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We would play every Friday &pound;5 a night = &pound;1 each (Worth about &pound;20
            each a night nowadays). We would have band practise twice a week in an old church hall in loughton. We
            worked on new numbers then would have a break, it was during one of these breaks that my brother Bill threw
            a knee pad at me. That was it. An all out war started with all these kneeling pads being thrown about.

            was the only one with a car, so I had to take all the gear to the venues, this meant doing everything twice.
            I remember once I had to break hard in </span><span class="c2">the car and one of the drums fell on

            the Jaywalkers. We did not take him on, what a mistake because he became famous with his group. We never did
            find anyone, so we kept it to instrumental numbers. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We did have one song where we sang on it, it was Guitar Man by Dwane Eddy. I was

            change there then) It was really hard to get anywhere for groups in those days. Today you have YouTube,
            TikTok, and other stations to get on to. Mind you, a while ago we found some old tapes of us playing and we
            did not sound anything like today&#39;s music. (Pam said still no change there then), this was because of

            one year. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I worked on van sales for about 10 years selling meat, pork pies, and sausages. I
            also worked for Kipling cakes. One job I went for was Passinghams, a meat pie and sausage firm. I went out
            with the manager to Gravesend in Kent. He wanted me to build a round in the Kent area. We went out the first
            day, well he was the manager but had no idea about selling. It happened that this was the same area I used
            to go to when I was on Farm Crust a few years ago. So the next day I went out on my own and approached all
            my old customers on the Kent round for business. (Jackpot) I went back with loads of goods sold, and half a
            round already made, they were well pleased. Then they said that the next day I would be in the factory
            making sausages, &ldquo;no I won&rsquo;t&rdquo; I said, I am a salesman not a sausage maker and told them I
            was leaving. The manager came running out and said, what about all the new customers that you got? I said I
            am not a Sausage maker, he was begging for me to stay with them. (See they knew that I was a fantastic

            will tell you I was only out of work for one week all my life). The last job I got was at Wonder Cakes. I
            built up a very large round and then the management decided to give the round to someone else after I had
            built it up. They said that they thought that I could build a new round up in Chelmsford. Remember, most of
            these sales jobs work on commission, so I was leaving a good wage and had to take a cut in salary, until I
            had built this new round up. I said to Pam I am going to give my notice and work for myself. Then whilst I
            was handing my notice in, the company called me into the office. I thought that they probably wanted me to
            stay. I went in and the Manager said to me that one of the clients on my old round was not buying as many
            cakes as I used to sell them. (This was because myself and the buyer of the Hospital that was being served
            were very good friends, so he would give me very large orders because he knew that I was on commission).
            Well I said hard luck, you should not have taken me off the round, and I was still going to leave.</span>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">We sold this caravan then brought a new 4 berth touring caravan. We went to many
            seaside places with this. I remember we parked the caravan on a farm up in Blackpool, let the kids out to
            play when they came back, Dave had cows poo in his hair. Tina had decided to lift him up over a fence and
            Dave fell into large cow pat. It took Pam about half an hour to get it out. Tina was a good at art and would
            draw sketches in her room night after night. She was good at school and managed to get her Bachelor of Arts,
            she now teaches in the same school she very first went to. Tina started Karate with me and at the same time
            Bob, my son in law, started. It was to be about ten years later, when they started dating each other. I
            think their first date was at the Live Aid concert in 1984. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Our son Dave was born 1969. Dave was lovely as well. I was downstairs with a
            friend who was staying with us at the time and Dave&rsquo;s first words were, &ldquo;can I have another pint
            please dad?&rdquo;. I must be honest, I can not remember Dave&rsquo;s first words but I know that he would
            put a W in front of every word. Pam went to buy some veg from the local greengrocer and the greengrocer said
            to Dave &ldquo;where are you going today?&rdquo; Dave said &ldquo;Wimin.&rdquo; What he was trying to say
            was swimming. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Dave was mad on football at school and was in the local kids team it was called
            Chigwell Boys. He was in the same team as Paul Alderson, the 1996 world Karate Champion (you will see his
            name later). I used to go running most days and I would take Dave over to the local park and kick a ball
            about with him. Then I would run around the field and Dave would kick around by himself. I have great
            respect for Dave who was good at school the same as Tina, gaining two A levels. He did not go to uni, he
            went to college (for one day). He came home and said to Pam that he did not like it. Pam said &ldquo;get a
            job then.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Dave started the next day at Littlewoods department store full time. He was only
            there a couple of years when he was transferred to the Oxford St London branch as assistant manager. He then
            got a job for Christian Salvesen Logistics and now works for DHL as a manager. Dave has worked his way up to
            management in most jobs that he has had, he works really hard. I hoped that he could have worked with me on
            the Karate clubs, but in the early days of Karate we were not sure if it was just a fad and would go away
            like most things in life, so we felt it was not a secure job for him. I have great respect for my daughter
            Tina as well, she started work as a graphic designer in London. She was earning megabucks, she then left
            this to be a School Teacher, but like she said to me, it&rsquo;s not worth doing a job if you don&rsquo;t
            like it no matter how much you earn. She has a great position at her school now and really loves her job. I
            did not realise that teachers have to work so hard, she is out of home at 7:30AM and gets home about 6:30PM.
            She then works in the evening sometimes. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Whilst she is teaching, Bob has been the housekeeper, bringing up all four kids
            when they were young. He has really made a good job of this. Bob will do anything and help anyone, he really
            is a great guy. (I put in what you told me to, Bob). </span></p>

            watch the games. In 1981 they got to the FA cup final and I said, &lsquo;Dave (because that&rsquo;s his
            name) let&rsquo;s go to Wembley and watch the game.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Dad, you will not get a
            ticket&rsquo;, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&rsquo; I said. We were on our way listening to all the Tottenham
            songs on the radio on the way. When we arrived at Wembley it did not take me long to smell out a tout.
            (There he is, I said to myself), we approached this guy who had two tickets for sale.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I think I paid about &pound;200 (don&rsquo;t tell Pam this, I told her we paid
            &pound;30 for the two tickets). It was well worth it, just to see the look on Dave&rsquo;s big beaming face,
            he was so pleased.</span><span class="c7 c2">(Football Joke: 1966 World cup final tickets were like gold

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Pam and I had a chat and discussed what I was going to do as a job. We had
            recently bought a new Ford Capri that was straight from the showroom and cost &pound;1800. I said that we
            would have to sell this to buy our own business. Well, we were lucky because this new car was in demand, so
            I sold it to my sister Mary&rsquo;s boyfriend for the same money that I had paid for it. Looking through the
            local paper, I found a Mobile Green Grocery business for sale for &pound;1,000, right up my street. (I knew
            that I can build this up with my sales experience) and that we could make a go of this. I went out on the
            round to learn the Green Grocery business in just one week, at the end of the week I had learned enough for
            this. If not, his shop was only a couple of miles away if I needed advice. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The round was all around Wanstead, Ilford and Dagenham, just a few miles from New
            North Rd Hainault which is where we lived. I had to go out on the round to make sure that it was taking the
            amount of money he said it was, before I would buy it. We worked out the figures and true enough there was
            &pound;85 profit. This was a good wage back in 1976 the job I had previously left, I was being paid
            &pound;35 a week. The van that came with the round was very old and about two tons. I bought a Transit Van
            and my dad and I built all the shelves. I put in a portable gas fire, so we had a Mobile Greengrocers. This
            was our first business and Pam and I put our heart and soul into it. We worked hard at this, getting a good
            wage working four days a week, we had the round for eight years. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would have to go to Stratford market to buy all the goods that I needed for the
            day, this meant leaving home at 5am, sometimes earlier. So this of course meant 9pm bedtime every night. You
            do have to be sharp when buying goods at the wholesale market, they would over charge you if they could. I
            was lucky that one of my Karate friends had a warehouse at Stratford and I would buy most of my goods from
            him, (If he stitched me up, at Karate I would beat him up, was our saying). We had lots of laughs on this
            round, the van had a sink, (We had to have this fitted because if the public health inspector came on the
            van, for a hygiene inspection, everything would be up to scratch). The heater was to warm up meat pies. When
            Tina (I think that&rsquo;s her name) was about 10 years old she would help me after school on the round. The
            customers loved her, so she was soon to be top saleslady on the round (after Pam). Dave followed in about a
            year helping as well, this gave him lots of confidence dealing with the public. They all loved him, he
            managed to get on well with all the customers. I believed that giving them jobs dealing with the public, put
            them in good stead for their future, giving them confidence to communicate with people in their future
            lives. ( I also had my Nephew Steven</span><span class="c2 c25">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c2">helping me
            on Saturday&rsquo;s).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I remember one day Dave was upset because we did not have any tickets for
            Tottenham v Liverpool in the league cup at Wembley, a customer I was serving said to me what&rsquo;s the
            matter with David he does not seem too happy. I told her about the football, &ldquo;leave it with me&rdquo;
            she said. Next week she gave Dave three tickets for the match FOC. Her uncle was one of the Tottenham
            accountants. Here we go again Wembley!! Wembley!! We arrived at Wembley early because we had one extra
            ticket left over to sell. This is where I became a ticket tout, realising that the money we got for the
            ticket, would buy us a burger and chips. I told Dave I was only going to ask the ticket price to someone
            that would be sitting next to us. (Making sure that he would not sell it on, to try and make money from it).
            Dave thought I was mad selling it so cheap, but then we did get the ticket free of course. Sadly Liverpool
            won so I had to console Dave &nbsp;all the way home (I won&rsquo;t tell them you cried Dave). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pam and I worked this round for eight years, Then one day, I made more profit at
            teaching Karate in one night than a full week selling greengrocery goods. I got home from the club and said
            to Pam that I would like to teach Karate full time. Pam had faith in me and this is what we did. Pam also
            had a part time job selling football pools coupons. (</span><span class="c6 c2">Silly Greengrocer joke: I

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">We went to the cinema one day and saw a film called Enter The Dragon. (We&rsquo;ll
            put the guitar away) I now had something else to put my all into. I told Pam that I was going to start
            training at Karate. I then told my siblings as well, they all laughed saying that would only last a week.
            Forty five years later, when I received my 7th Dan Black Belt from the British Karate Association, I often
            remind them what they all said. Training at Karate was hard because I was trying to keep up with other
            students that were half my age. So my plan was, they would train once a week, I would train through the day
            and every night at clubs or at home. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">My first instructor was a guy called David Slapper. He was a Brown belt in
            Shotokan. I had private lessons with him for about ten months. I remember grading with his instructor, there
            were three of us taking the grading, myself, a young lady and the drummer from Manfred Mann the pop group,
            Mike Hugg. I was first, don&rsquo;t think I made too many mistakes, next was the young lady, I think it was
            Mike Hugg&rsquo;s girlfriend. She was great. Then Mike Hugg&rsquo;s turn, he was not so good, he was so
            nervous. After the lesson, I said to him, how come you were so nervous? He said he can play in front of
            thousands of people because he did this all the time, but grading, not so often. Anyhow, we all passed. The
            girl got 1st class myself &nbsp;2nd and Mike 3rd, I went home with the new Red Belt next to me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was so pleased that the last 10 months were worth it. Soon after my grading there
            was a new club opening up at the Community Centre in Limes Farm Chigwell. I put my name down and was being
            taught by </span><span class="c7 c2">Alfie Pitkin</span><span class="c2">.</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;I
            have never seen anyone so fast, he was magic. This pushed me to do more training every day of the week. Two
            hours a day, running one hour a day with this. I was getting really fit and loved Karate. I managed to
            achieve my Green belt in 1974 with the UKKW. This was after two years training. (In those days there were
            only four belts to obtain. White, Green, Brown and then after about 5/10 years of training to grade for
            Black Belt. (In Japanese it&#39;s called Sho Dan meaning 1st step). </span></p>

            things that were important like distance, speed, power and most of all timing. I was only a green belt when
            I started teaching the kids at his club, my two children were in the lessons. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tina managed to obtain her Black Belt, about 8 years later, Dave was more interested
            in girls so only managed to get to Brown belt. I continued to train and soon I was training with the top

        </span><span class="c2">Meada</span><span class="c9 c2">, all top instructors. I was also training at a club in

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I asked a friend at the club, Ian Cuthbert, to help me run a club. The club at
            Limes Farm had closed down. We did this under the umbrella of Sensei Wills, Ian said yes and we were off.
            The building of the Roding Karate Club 47 years later is still going strong with my son-in-law at the helm.
            &nbsp;Both Ian and I were going to build a great Karate Club at Limes Farm. Ian was teaching the adults and
            left me with the kids, we loved it, there is no better feeling than passing on knowledge to others. I got on
            very well with Ian and we had some great years in Karate together. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We would go to different clubs, to try to improve our knowledge of karate. We took
            part in lot&rsquo;s of fetes in the summer. I remember that one day at a fete in Epping it was held in a big
            area. We were about to start our demo, then Ian said to me &ldquo;lets go where all the people are and
            pretend to have a real fight&rdquo;. There we were fighting away, then we stopped and Ian shouted out
            &nbsp;&ldquo;if you want to see more then go to the karate area&rdquo;. They all rushed over, we did knife
            techniques and tile breaking. My speciality was breaking the tiles after they were set alight. &nbsp;
        </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Karate joke: Why did the Cupboard learn Karate? For Shelf-Defense)</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I used to go running every day and started to run further and further, so one day
            I decided to run a marathon. The training was really hard, I followed the SAS program which was very hard
            training. I could not get an application form for the London Marathon so I marked out 27 miles round our
            local park and started training. It was the start of summer and it was too hot to run in the afternoon when
            I finished work, so I would go out at 6am in the morning before I went to market, to pick up each day&#39;s
            stock of fruit and vegetables to sell during the day. I got the club involved and had the kids running for
            charity. I managed to finish in just under 4 hours, (not bad for a 39 year old) just to show how fit I was.
            &nbsp;After the run we played football.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Ian received his Black belt in 1979. We were so pleased for him. Ian helped me get
            my training together by making sure that I went to as many clubs as possible. I remember I would go with Ian
            to Picketts Lock Sports Centre in Enfield on Mondays to train with the Top Instructor Tatsuo- Suzuki. This
            was always a hard training session. The best fighters in England would come to this club on Mondays. Vic
            Charles, Jeff Thomson, these were England team members and they were Green belts they were so good and fast,
            lots of times I would be on the end of a kick or punch. Going back to this time, the late 70s there were not
            many places to train at, not like nowadays you have Karate clubs at the end of your Road. We had to go to
            North London, East London and different Counties in England for competitions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I received my Black Belt in 1981 (After 9 years of training). My friend Ian was a
            hard fighter and about 16 years younger than me. He always came first in all the competitions we entered. I
            could never beat him. I had this back roundhouse kick called Ushiro Mawashi-geri. It&#39;s a famous kick
            Bruce Lee would use. He called it &lsquo;The dragon whips his tail&rsquo;. I worked hard on this kick since
            the first day of putting on a karate suit. Then one day at a training session with instructor Lawrence Wills
            at The Brook School Loughton we were sparing, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, there it goes, a perfect kick on the side
            of Ian&rsquo;s face, he was surprised. This was the first time that I had beaten him in a fight. In 1979 the
            club I was training with were going to West London for a friendly Karate tournament. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lawrence picked the team to go and put me down as a reserve. I travelled with Ian in
            his car. When we arrived they were sorting the teams out, my 7 year old son Dave was to be our mascot. I was
            left on the sidelines when a German Black Belt Girl came and asked me if I was fighting. I told her that I
            was a reserve. She asked if I would like to fight with her team, I said I would ask Lawrence. He said yes
            that&rsquo;s ok as it&#39;s </span><span class="c2">only a friendly</span><span class="c2">. (Not
        </span><span class="c2">such thing as a</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c2">friendly</span><span class="c2">. As in football, no such thing, you want to win). She took me
            over to meet the German coach. He said to me that although we have asked you to fight, you may not have to,
            because my team will win in the first three fights. This </span><span class="c2">meant leaving</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;two people will not have to fight. They were so confident when the first fighters came out,
            Germany </span><span class="c2">win</span><span class="c2">, 2nd fight Germany </span><span
            class="c2">win</span><span class="c2">, 3rd fight Germany </span><span class="c2">win</span><span
            class="c9 c2">. The Germans and this Englishman had won. I went up to receive my medal and all my club mates
            were a little bit fed up. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the way home I was polishing my medal in front of Ian winding him up. I started to
            have lessons with Sensei Meada at the Judokan Do-Jo in Hammersmith. I was a Green Belt and it wasn&rsquo;t
            long before he awarded me my Brown Belt. When you sparred with Sensei </span><span
            class="c2">Meada</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;you had to be very careful because he had this special
            technique, this was when he would turn a front kick into a round kick. What this meant was, as the front
            kick came to your mid- body, you would put your arm down to block, he would then change it into the round
            kick that was aimed to your face. This you could not block because you have committed yourself to blocking
            the front kick. He would catch me and lots of other young good fighters with this technique. When executing
            this kick you have to think that the technique is just one movement. Not a front kick and then a round kick.
            It was front/round at the same time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I trained with Sensei Meada for six months then he returned to Japan. Before he
            went he told me to have lessons with Shiomitzu Sensei who had just come to England from Madagascar where he
            had been teaching. He gave me Shiomitzu&rsquo;s telephone number.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I trained with Sensei </span><span class="c2">Shiomitzu</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;for about three years, he then awarded me with 1st Dan Black Belt. A few weeks after I was
            awarded my Black Belt by Sensei Shiomitzu, I arrived at his Dojo for my normal lesson. He congratulated me
            on getting my Black Belt and said later &ldquo;we celebrate&rdquo;. (I was thinking that we would go to the
            pub after). We did the normal lesson, then he said &ldquo;we spar&#39;&#39; (word for fight). Well, this was
            really different, because he was attacking me really hard. (Remember he was one of the hardest fighters
            coming out of Japan) he was getting close with his kicks and punches, then one kick caught me very hard in
            the body. I was getting a bit worried as he came in, I threw a punch to his head to keep him away, this
            knocked him to the floor. (</span><span class="c7 c2">thanks Alfie</span><span class="c9 c2">) I had
            remembered what Alfie said about timing (As soon as he moves attack). With his nose bleeding, I was stunned,
            so I went to him to say sorry, he then said it was not my fault it was his, because he should have blocked
            the punch.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">After the lesson, Terry Laurence, a Black belt from the next Dojo (training area),
            came up to me and asked me what all the screaming was. I explained what had happened when we started the
            lesson about celebrating. He said you fool, when they celebrate someone receiving their Black Belt, the
            celebration is they all give the new Black Belt a hard time. This is what Sensei </span><span
            class="c2">Shiomitzu</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;was doing. (Remember there were no hand mitts or gloves
            in those days).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We had arranged for Sensei to </span><span class="c2">take a grading</span><span
            class="c9 c2">&nbsp;for my students. When he met Pam he said to her &nbsp;&ldquo;look what he done to my
            face,&rdquo; he was showing her the scar on his nose.(I often wonder if he still has it.) He came to
            Hainault when we bought the Bungalow in Chestnut Grove. We were decorating at the time when he came in, he
            was looking around the place and Pam had just finished painting a wall that was still wet. Sensei was
            getting very close to it and he had a very expensive Crombie overcoat. He was getting closer and closer to
            it then went into another room, lucky for us. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="c3"style="text-align: center;"><span class="c4 c2">Sensei Shiomitzu and myself 1977. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The private tuition with Sensei Shiomitzu was mostly basic techniques and Kata. It
            was in one of these lessons he introduced me to a friend of his. I think it may have been his old Instructor
            who was over from Japan on holiday in the u/k. His name was Tanabe and in the session that we had was
            myself, Tony Heap a Black belt 4th Dan who was a very fast fighter and Sensei Shiomitzu. Sensei Tanabe
            wanted to fight Tony, I thought there was going to be blood here because, as I said, Tony was very fast.
            Tony started to fight but was taking it easy because he thought that he might catch Tanabe who was a lot
            older, but he said to Tony why don&rsquo;t you fight properly you are too slow. I thought, here we go,
            bloodbath, but no, as Tony kicked him, Sensei Tanabe moved to the side, just enough to doge the kicks and
            punches. Tony could not get anywhere near him he moved to the side so fast, and kept getting out of the way
            of Tony. When the session was over Sensei Tanabe said this is a very good move in Wado Karate its called Tai
            Sabaki. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The Roding Karate Club decided to pull out of the UKKW (United Kingdom Karate
            Wado-Kai) Sensei Shiomitzu said that he could not teach me any more, because we had left the UKKW. The
            reason that Ian and I had decided to leave the UKKW was because they were bringing in lots of changes that
            we did not agree with. I then started a long association with Sensei Shinohara, he was a brilliant coach. I
            learnt a lot from Sensei Shinohara. I can remember we were training near where I lived in Epping. There was
            just myself and him, when suddenly we heard an Aircraft flying low, we both looked out of the window, I said
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok sensei it&#39;s one of our&rsquo;s&rdquo; he laughed so much. Him being Japanese and me
            being English, and it being an American Harvard Aircraft. This made us laugh because, remember, in 1939 we
            were at war with each other. This is the same aircraft that pop star Gary Numan used to fly from at North
            Weald Airfield. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">At this time I was having tuition on the computer. (Remember they did not have
            computers in schools when I went to school). I had bought an Apple Mac. My daughter, Tina, showed me how to
            work it for what I needed for my work. What Tina taught me I was passing on to Pam who now teaches me the
            computer. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Computer Joke: What do you call a computer mouse that swears a
            lot? A cursor!) </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I then got one of the first digital cameras and started producing small books on
            Karate. I had lots of Instructors wanting these books. They would come to the hall and I would take photos,
            and put them in a book. These were Kata books. It took a lot of hours of work on my part, but I loved doing
            the job. Anyway, I put more money into the club. Sensei Shinohara wanted a book made up for him to sell to
            his students. These were pictures of the Kata moves for his style of Karate. I took the pictures and Sensei
            looked to make sure that he had the correct stance in each picture. When he said ok to them, I would produce
            the book and show him the proof.</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp;(Silly Computer joke: Don&rsquo;t fart in
            an Apple store, cos they don&rsquo;t have Windows).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the book was finished. When I showed him the book he said &ldquo;this no
            good&rdquo; and started to pick problems with his stance on some pictures. He wanted to do the photo shoot
            again. I then printed the new lot of pictures up, showed him, and </span><span class="c2">yep,</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;you got it, he wanted to do them again. He was such a perfectionist, we spent hours on his
            books. It cost me a fortune in time wasted. I could have produced another three Karate Instructors books in
            that time. At the time I was doing lots of this sort of work, but as I had not long been using a computer it
            was an enjoyable job. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Computer Joke: The oldest computer can be traced
            back to Adam and Eve. It was an apple but with extremely limited memory. Just 1 byte. And then everything
            crashed).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The club was expanding, we were getting so many new calls about Karate. I said to Pam
            I think I will have to get one of those Telephone Answer Machines. (These had just started to come on the
            market) a friend of mine had one, so I borrowed it until I got my own one. We opened another club in
            Wanstead, then Ian went off to Australia to see his brother and left me to run the clubs for a few months. I
            was a greengrocer by day and karate instructor by night. A few months later Ian started to teach ladies self
            defence so we decided that I could have the clubs and he started teaching self defence in London. We were
            charging 75 </span><span class="c2">pence a lesson</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;for adults and children.
            ( I was paying &pound;25 a lesson for my private lesson with Shiomitzu in 1976). After Ian went off to teach
            the Posh Ladies in London, I started to spend more time on teaching, children mainly. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I get on well with kids. They are so much fun, I would get them playing games
            running up and down in teams, this would start to get them fit and understand working in teams for later
            when they compete. It was about this time that I was teaching at a club in Barking. A woman came running
            into the club with a baby who had stopped breathing, the baby had a purple like face so I quickly put the
            baby on the floor and called Pam over. (We have both received our experience in first aid on a regular
            basis, so we knew what to do). Pam was working with me, &ldquo;has she got a pulse&rdquo; said Pam? I said
            &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I just gave the baby chest compressions with my finger tips. She came back to life, we
            were so pleased. Pam and I had done something that we train for, we felt really great that day. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Another time this happened was at North Weald Market. A baby was choking, she had
            swallowed a sweet, and the Mum was panicking. So I took the baby from her and turned the baby upside down,
            taped the baby&rsquo;s back, and out popped a sweet. Another job done. The clubs by now were getting bigger
            and bigger so I opened up more, Ilford, Loughton, Goodmayes, Collier Row Romford, then got the jackpot. It
            was called Dagenham. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">When I arrived to teach at the new Dagenham club, I saw this big queue. I spoke to
            someone in the queue and asked them what they were there for, they said a new Karate Club was starting.
            Fifty one people had turned up, there was no way I could even get them in the hall. &nbsp;Pam came up with
            one of &nbsp;her good ideas and said she would go and see the caretaker, and ask to have the hall for a
            further 2 hours. I managed to get them all sitting down and explained to them that although I was the best
            instructor in the world, I could not teach them all at once. This got quite a laugh, I said that I would do
            a demonstration and explain all about Karate. I then got twenty up at a time showing them how to do the
            first two blocks of Karate. Then get the next group up showing them two more blocks. We did not charge
            anything for the lesson that night, but took orders for Karate suits, for them to wear next time. Meanwhile
            Pam had sorted out different times for them over the three hours, then we managed to get the hall for two
            days in future. I noticed that the people in Dagenham would rather spend their rent money on a Karate suit
            than pay their rent. We had over 100 members in the Dagenham club in 2 weeks. Dagenham was a big club. It
            was at this time that my brother had left his job on the London Transport. He asked me for a job, so working
            together, I showed him how to get halls. Open new clubs and run the clubs. This was so that when I was
            unable to make it, he could keep it ticking over. Also it was handy that he lived just down the road to me.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Pete is just like my dad, he can put his hand to anything, and it wasn&rsquo;t
            long before he was making Trophies for the club. Since the start of our summer camps we would use quite a
            lot of these. Also, we would be running our own competitions at club level, and would need the Trophies for
            this. I opened a shop selling Karate suits and belts etc.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">There was really only one place to buy suits and this was a shop in South London
            called Blitz. Which means on this side of London and Essex there were no shops selling this type of stock. I
            opened the shop in Epping and Pete was going to be there every day to advertise and sell to whoever came in.
            I myself had lots of fellow Karate instructors from clubs all over Essex that I knew buying the Karate
            goods. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">JJB Sports showed interest, they wanted a sample which I sent up to them.
            &nbsp;They then put a big order in for lots of stock. (At the time JJB Sports shops were very strong up
            north ). I had never heard of them down here in the south, however I gave them a call and got through to
            them. I sent them the Invoice stating payment in five days. They called back and said that it would be 30
            days before I would get my money, that&rsquo;s the way they work. I said to Pam I am going to pull out. I
            did not want to be stitched up,!! BIG BIG MISTAKE !! I did not realise they were such a big company. I
            noticed that they started opening Sports shops in Essex London all over the place, it was a big company and
            I had let it slip through my fingers. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I bought my stock from a seller in Pakistan and would have to pick these up from
            Birmingham in a big 3 ton truck. This started off well, then, although the stock was of good quality, Blitz
            started to undercut us and the shop was not selling enough to keep open. I had to close it down. I said to
            Pete that he could have the clubs that he was teaching at for himself and that he could open his own clubs
            for himself. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I was left to run the clubs by myself. I had arranged to open a Karate club in
            Romford. We would be training in a big area upstairs in the Dolphin Swimming Club. I was so lucky because
            the night before they had shown the film Karate Kid on television. Here we go again. 45 student&#39;s
            arrived for this one. Off you go Pam, more nights please. We were lucky because I was friends with the
            manager Steve (He was a Spurs fan like myself) he helped us out. The clubs got bigger and bigger and soon a
            Martial Arts Journalist from Manchester got to hear about the different way I was teaching at the clubs. The
            difference is that I was teaching the kids teamwork. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I would have junior Black Belts teach adults on a one to one for short sessions. I
            found out that most adults would rather be taught by a child because it takes the pressure off them.( An
            adult would want to know how to do the move but had a problem trying to remember the moves, whereas a child
            can remember moves straight away. Although the adult will perfect the move, after coming to me with practice
            ). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The Junior Black belt would also teach other kids that found it difficult to learn
            the moves. This would take a lot of pressure of me because it gave me more time with the serious students.
            The other difference was what an adult had told me, when I asked him why he had left his last club, he said
            &ldquo;It&#39;s good to come and train in an atmosphere that was friendly and that you control all the
            fighting, so that we don&#39;t go home with black eyes and injuries.&rdquo; I am proud of the students that
            managed to fight for England and also giving Paul Alderson the 1996 World Champion, his first introduction
            into Karate when he was 7 years old (I remember Paul&rsquo;s dad Colin Telephoning me from South Africa half
            way through the night to tell me of his win). </span></p>

            someone, your brain tells your hand to go to its target asap. Well there are two movements involved here,
            you tell your brain to do it, then your fist goes to the target, well with a person with muscle twitch, your
            fist reacts as soon as you think of the technique, so its only one movement, so this with a lot of training
            makes you faster in fighting. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The club had a lot of good fighters come along, and even to this day I often walk
            along the street and people say hello to me. I was taking a Sunday walk along Burnham-on-crouch a little
            while ago and someone called my name, he said Hi Ray &ldquo;I said I am sorry you got me,&rdquo; he said
            &ldquo;it&#39;s Paul I trained with you about 40 years ago.&rdquo; No wonder I could not remember, he was
            only 14 when I taught him then. I remembered he was a friend of my Dad&rsquo;s and lived near to me in
            Chigwell.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">It was 1977 when my friend Ian Cuthbert asked me to phone the BBC because they
            wanted someone to break some tiles for a demonstration on TV. I gave them a call, they asked if I would go
            along to White City to break some roof tiles. They were going to demonstrate a high speed video camera, and
            they wanted me to break about 10 tiles so they could see which one brakes first. The top or bottom one. I
            went along with Pam and set up the roofing tiles in the morning. I showed them how I was going to break the
            tiles, they set the camera up and away we go. I did this a couple of times, then they asked me to stay the
            rest of the day. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">They gave us a tour of the studio, showing us where they do Top of the Pops. We
            then went off for a bite to eat. I still had my Karate Gi on and soon it was time to do the show. The show
            was called Tomorrow&#39;s World fronted by Keith Chegwin&rsquo;s wife Maggie Philbin. Keith Chegwin combed
            my hair for me, in those days I had long curly hair. It was about time to do the show. I thought that it was
            nice of them to let us stay and see the Programme. Which went out live, then they said ok Ray this is where
            you do the break. (Now I thought that they were going to use the breaks that I had done in the morning, no
            such luck, live in front of a few million viewers). No problem. I had done this hundreds of times at
            fete&rsquo;s and demo&rsquo;s. I first learnt to break tiles when I would go to watch other people do this
            at big competitions. The demonstration went well, now it was time to talk about my fee for the day. I had
            two ways to receive my fee, if they use the demo once or if they use it more than once, if I chose the
            latter it would be less, I chose the first one and got paid there on the spot. (Well they said they would
            post it on).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">My next TV appearance was on a Programme called What&rsquo;s My Line. This is where
            celebrities had to guess my occupation. I was to mime clues and answer their questions with a yes or no.
            They had ten chances to guess my occupation. They could not do it and I won. Angela Rippon asked me to break
            some tiles on the show. I had to have an interview with Angela Rippon, she knew so much about Karate she
            asked me about the different instructors that I have trained with. &nbsp;Pam and I met lots of celebrities

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The Roding Karate Club has Raised over &pound;24,000 for charities over the years,
            the first big charity was for a friend that I would talk to on the CB radio. He was 14 year old David
            Walker, he had Spina bifida and had to be in a wheelchair. They were going to get him an electric
            wheelchair, and I said I would help. We had two Karate children&rsquo;s parents that offered to help me. The
            first one was the parent of a student that I got very friendly with. The boy&#39;s name was Scott Curzon, he
            first walked into my Chigwell club with a Tottenham Hotspurs T shirt on. I looked at him and said, you are
            definitely Black Belt material with that shirt on. It was my football team, the parent laughed and
            introduced himself as Bernie. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The next one was an adult I was teaching. His name was Sidney. The three of us and
            Pam got together and started to make plans on how we were going to raise the money. Pam suggested that we
            have an afternoon tea party at our Bungalow in Hainault. We had all our CB radio friends. It&#39;s good to
            meet fellow CB friends in person, you talk to them for years and not know who they are. This soon had our
            garden full of friends. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I had a big club now so I put out a newsletter for the students to get sponsors,
            we decided to do sponsored sit ups and push ups. We soon got this on the way and money started to come in.
            The first thing I did was open a bank account in young David&#39;s name so that we could save the funds.
            Bernie came up with asking some of his business friends for donations. Bernie was a car dealer and had a
            couple of garages. Sidney owned a big number of curtain retail shops, so he did the same. A friend of mine
            from the CB club Terry Jenkins got in touch with Chigwell Council to ask permission to use a large park in
            Hainault to run a one day Fete. This raised about &pound;1,500. One of the events was a sponsored walk
            around the field. There was a quadriplegic boy in a wheelchair being pushed by a blind man, with his wife
            showing him which way to go. There were lots of my CB club friends helping out, I could go on forever
            thanking these kind people that helped on that day. It did not take long to get the money for the electric
            wheelchair. We also had money to buy David a computer so that it would help with his studies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">David was 14 years old at the time, the very sad part of this story is that the chair
            was delivered and David passed away the next day. It was so sad, I remember the funeral, there were people
            in large numbers outside the church, because the church was full. Both Pam and I loved David, he was in so
            much pain the most of his life, and having the amount of operations I have had with pain, I now know how he
            felt. He never complained, he was a very happy kid and we missed him very much. When he was on the CB radio,
            it was very hard to talk to him, because he was so popular with everyone, that you could not get through on
            the air waves. We had money over so I suggested that we buy the boy in the wheelchair, who was at the fete a
            special car for him to drive. This was a new Ford Escort and we had to take it to this special garage near
            Heathrow Airport. That would fit changes to the car so that the quadriplegic child would be able to drive.
            The money that was over was donated to Claybury hospital to buy them some computers,we did lot&rsquo;s of
            charities in the coming years most of this going to Haven Hospital. The year of these events were about
            1982/85 </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Charity Joke I was thrown out of the charity food kitchen on my

    <p class="c3"style="text-align: center;"><span class="c4 c2">Myself and Sensei Shinohara </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Anyway, back to Karate. We made a lot of friends at Karate, we would have Summer
            Camps twice a year and had lots of fun. I remember one day a student came up and told me that there was a
            girl student (she was from Sweden) in the mens shower and was talking to them. She said that the ladies
            showers were not working and could she use the men&#39;s showers. Well the boys were in for a treat that day
            as she took all her clothes off. I was taking my parents out to lunch that day so I missed the show. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Sensei Shinohara would make a guest appearance at the camps. The students loved
            him and his great sense of humour. He was a great instructor, sadly no longer with us. I thought of a way,
            at one stage of the club&#39;s history, that we could get an even higher standard of student. I thought of
            making the advanced student take extra special lessons, this worked a charm with students improving by one
            hundred percent in their gradings. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">They also had to take part in outer competitions because you have to let the
            student see his or her progress outside their club, this can only be done by doing this. Any Karate club
            that does not enter competitions between other clubs and keeps it all in house, can never see how good their
            standard is. I was always fair with the grading of all students making sure that they were confident in what
            they were doing. I always said that if I recommended a student for grading, I felt that they were capable of
            doing well in the grade. Obviously you have to take nerves into consideration when grading. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">When the advanced students take their Black Belt Dan grade I would always have a
            panel of at least three Senior Dan grades marking up the scores, as well as myself. In the Black belt
            grading, the student will have to spar with about 30 students, these are made up from Brown belts and above.
            This would test the students fighting skills as well as their stamina. They would have to show about 4 or 5
            Katas (Forms of movement) as well as what they are doing in the kata. They would have to take a Karate
            theory test. I have many parents saying to me that they find the sparring to be brutal. I point out to the
            parents that it is not hard for the student because they have been doing it for about 6/8 years. The Black
            Belt Grading lasts about one and a half hours. We encourage students to enter club competitions, then
            inter-club competitions then, to fight at outer club competitions. This is a building platform for students
            to enter The English Championships, then onto World Karate Championships. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Roding Karate Club </span><span class="c2">have</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;about 160 trophies from different competitions (these are on show at The Jo Richardson
            School Dagenham). We soon started to get more Black Belts going through the club, this meant of course, more
            help for me as a lot of them would teach for me at my own clubs. I think I have probably taught over 2,000
            student&rsquo;s all through the years that I was teaching. The system we had at The Roding Karate Club was,
            if I saw a child or adult with good fighting ability I would send them to our three instructors that were
            running the competition side of the club. Dean </span><span class="c2">Ince</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;was
            a 5th Dan Black Belt and he would teach the students how to fight. People don&rsquo;t realise that there are
            so many things to learn about combat, they </span><span class="c2">had</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;to
            learn when to attack or when to counter attack. This means, for instance, I was a counter attack fighter.
            This would mean that you wait for your opponent to attack you, then at the correct time you attack him with
            your technique. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is what I would call picking off your attacker. If you were an attacker, you
            would have to move in fast, this is so you hit your target before he could counter attack. </span><span
            class="c2">I have an</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;example of this is, I was coaching a team at a
            competition in the early 90s. I had a green belt from my club coming up against a brown belt higher grade, I
            was watching this brown belt in a previous bout. I said to the green belt, (the student&#39;s name was Greg
            Wallace) I have watched this guy fight and he keeps coming forward all the time. I said to Greg just listen
            to my voice and you will win. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">(A fighter should listen to his coach only, because you want them to only hear your
            voice on the mat). I said as soon as he moves you go in with your counter as fast as you can. The brown came
            forward, I said now Greg, Greg executed a punch that knocked the guy back. This was first point to Greg. The
            brown belt came forward again, Greg did what he did the first time and countered with a punch to the mid
            section. He received another point for this, he did this three times and won the fight. He came off the mat
            really pleased, he said to me that he could only hear my voice coaching him all the time. What Greg was
            learning here was timing, now if you&#39;re fighting, you need to get the distance correct, after this you
            need to train for speed. Then next is power, you have to have a powerful punch or kick. Power, Speed,
            Distance and Timing is what you have to work on by doing lots and lots of repetitions. </span><span
            class="c6 c2">(Silly fighting joke.. Never get into fights with ugly people, they have nothing to
            lose).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">This meant </span><span class="c2">Greg, now a 5th Dan, and Dean were to teach at the
            club. We had another Instructor Steve Brame 5th Dan who would teach Kata (forms of movement) at his class,
            for the squad. Nearly every Sunday, Greg would take a squad to competitions and spend the day with them
            coaching. He did not get paid for this; he just loved watching the student progress at competitions. It was
            about this time that I started to run Karate Summer Camps. This was a good move because it would be a
            busman&rsquo;s holiday for us. We taught karate for about five hours during the day, then students were able
            to go to the club house and drink orange juice. ? That&rsquo;s what they were supposed to drink. (The barman
            at the camp said to me one day, that the Karate students from Dagenham would drink more beer in the one
            week, than three weeks in the summer peak season). </span><span class="c7 c2">(Silly bar joke two guys walk

            the students up the Thames on a boat trip and BBQ on the boat. This was a great day and I was presented with
            my 6th Dan from Dean Ince on behalf of the BKA. On the train on our way home, my brother Bill had one too
            many drinks and was showing all the people on the train my 6th Dan certificate, at the same time pointing to
            me, this was very funny with all the people on the train laughing at him. The Roding Karate Club is still

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We are taught in Karate never attack first in thought or deed, however sometimes this
            is a hard thing to hold back, especially when your appointment has no control. This happened in a lesson I
            was training in, two new Brown Belts came into the Do-Jo (training Hall). Sensei Shinohara was the
            instructor, he told us to pair up for sparring. I looked across at the two new Brown belts sitting on the
            side and one nudged the other and mouthed &ldquo;watch this&rdquo; (he did not notice that myself and
            Shinohara had seen him and he started to laugh). I thought to myself thanks for the warning. He came and
            stood in front of me waiting for the command from sensei to commence, we both bowed and got into fighting
            stance, my thoughts were right, he steamed in to hit me. When he was in distance my left hand jab has always
            been fast, I hit him on the nose and cut his mouth. ( </span><span class="c7 c2">Thanks Alf </span><span
            class="c9 c2">) Perfect timing, he went over to Sensei and complained, Sensei said to him I saw you nudge

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have often been asked by people if I have ever had to use my Karate in the street,
            my answer is only once. I was driving our greengrocery van to work one day. I said to Pam &ldquo;I&#39;m not
            sure if I should keep this Karate going&rdquo;. I had been to a lesson the night before and had a kick catch
            me on the head, near my eye that made me have a b</span><span class="c2">lack eye.</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;So this day, I had a bad headache, then a few minutes later we had to turn left at a
            T-junction. As I was about to turn the corner a car overtook me and made me swerve up the pavement. I
            managed to keep going then overtook him and got out to tell him that he should not have done what he did.
            (Or words to that effect). He got out of his car and started to attack me, well the first punch I did, cut
            his eye. ( </span><span class="c7 c2">thanks Alf )</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;He still kept coming next
            jab nose, every time he moved forward he could not understand why he was being hit. I hit him once more then
            Pam shouted to me &ldquo;stop Ray that&rsquo;s enough&rdquo; His face was covered in blood, as she shouted
            he looked at her as if to say thanks. Then it was my right hand that put him on the floor. I thought to
            myself, what have I done? I got back in the van and drove off leaving him there. I drove around the corner
            and I thought Pam was really going to have a go at me. She looked at me and said brilliant, you did
            everything that you normally do in the Do-Jo except you made contact. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I was expecting a visit from the Police, still remember, I thought to myself he
            threw the first punch at me. I did have a black Eye from the night before to show the police (what he did
            not do). You must remember I was not being a bully by hitting him. If he had stopped coming forward, I would
            have left it at that. Sometimes you only have to show in your actions that you are in charge, this was when
            my 11 year old son Dave was helping me on the greengrocery van. He came back to the van soaking wet, he was
            crying. I said &ldquo;what happened Dave&rdquo;, he said &ldquo;those two men up there soaked me with their
            hosepipe.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;did they do it on purpose?&rdquo;he said &ldquo;yes they were
            laughing&rdquo;, I said &ldquo;lets go and see them.&rdquo; I said to the guy holding the hose &ldquo;Did
            you aim that hosepipe at my son deliberately&rdquo; he said yes, they were really cocky. I said
            &ldquo;ok&rdquo;, took the hose pipe from his hand and shoved it down the front of his shirt and just held
            it there. I looked at his mate and said &ldquo;move if you dare&rdquo;. He said sorry, I was still holding
            the hose pipe down the other guy&rsquo;s shirt. He was soaking wet by now. Then we just walked away, David
            loved it to see them get what they deserved. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The next time we were working up Limes Farm Chigwell on the van. Dave had taken a
            shortcut across the end of a garden. A man came back to the van shouting at Dave as he got to the van. I
            said go away (even more, words to that effect) he turned his back and walked off. He knew that was the best
            thing for him to do. What I want to know is why always David ? I don&#39;t have this problem with Tina.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was on my way to teach our Wanstead club one day with a girl called Dawn who lived
            across the Road. I often took her because she would like extra training. Anyway, I was about to enter a
            junction at the end of our road. I did not see the car coming down the road on my right and had to pull up
            sharp so as not to hit him, he got out of the car. (I thought here we go again) I got out of the car and
            said sorry to him and that it was my fault. He said &ldquo;are you ok ? I was making sure you&#39;re
            ok.&rdquo; I thought to myself why is he apologising? It was my fault. I got back into the car and Dawn said
            to me it was a good job you had your Karate suit on Sensei. I then </span><span
            class="c2">realised</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;I had got out of the car with karate suit and Black belt
            on, we both laughed all the way to the club.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">In later years it was Dave&#39;s turn to stand fast, I was an old man now and we
            were in our seats at Tottenham watching the match. The man behind me kept booing in my ear, I turned round
            and told him about this but he still kept doing it. Then at half time Dave leaned over and said don&rsquo;t
            shout in Dad&rsquo;s ear anymore. We never got a peep out of him again, the man had seen the look in
            Dave&#39;s eye, seeing that he meant it. People in the seats near us said to me that this man was a nuisance
            and always shouting abuse.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I can remember one time there was a heated discussion going on in a club that I
            was teaching between a child&rsquo;s parent and one of my Instructors. I told them both to go outside the
            Do-Jo to settle their discussion. This was happening just as we were about to go home. Someone came up to me
            and told me that there was a fight going on outside. I rushed outside to stop the Instructor and parent
            fighting, straight away I got in-between them knowing that they had no grudge with me, it was with each
            other they had the &nbsp;problem with. (The parent was winning the fight at this stage, by the way). I had a
            go at them saying that they should set an example, they both went home. Next day the parent came up to me
            and said sorry boss (this is what he used to call me) he wound me up so much.Then when we got outside he
            wanted to fight, he said the instructor did not realise that I have been working the doors up Newcastle for
            ten years. So remember, 3rd Dan Black Belt against a Doorman be careful. You never know in this world who is
            better in any confrontation, so don&rsquo;t get into road rage or any unnecessary confrontation.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"style="text-align: center;"><span class="c4 c2">Pam and myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">As I said, we had a great time teaching Karate and Pam made so many friends. We
            had lots of holidays whilst we were working, our favourite being Los Angeles. We would go to Santa Monica
            every year for a well earned rest. We normally travel mid class on Virgin Atlantic, but found out that if
            you ask prior to the flight about two hours before, if you are smartly dressed and polite and ask for any
            upgrades they will upgrade you to first class FOC. I think we managed to upgrade about eight times, free of
            charge. (Some people would be paying up to &pound;3,000 for a first class seat). We went to Hawaii one year
            from Los Angeles and went to see Pearl Harbour. They had the original Arizona ( still under water where it
            went down). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">We went to Cyprus in 1996 we had rented a brand new Bungalow, in fact they still
            had to finish the garden and around the pool. We agreed to this and we had a few days of peace and quiet,
            then it all happened. We could hear a cement mixer coming up the driveway, I approached the driver who told
            me that they were going to lay cement around the swimming pool. As you can imagine this was out of order, so
            I told them not to empty the mixer today. I then went to see the owner and told him, he said that they had
            to lay the cement or it would be no good and they would have to dump it. I told him if they come back I
            would drive his Jeep, that we hired from him, into the swimming pool. So he quickly moved us to an apartment
            overlooking the sea. We said ok and headed for the apartment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Through the night Pam noticed a load of cockroaches all over the place, they were
            the biggest we had ever seen. Next morning I went over to see the owner and told him that we were going to
            stay at the 5-star Hotel up the road and he would have to pay for it. He reluctantly paid for the rest of
            our holiday. I was pleased then because not only were we in a nice room it had a television in it. There
            were not many places with tv in Cyprus at that time, anyway England were to play Holland that night and I
            watched England beat Holland 5 -0. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">It was at this hotel that I remembered that the new car registrations were to come
            out in a few weeks and it was going to be P reg so, I thought I wonder if they have sold P1 NAN yet, I gave
            them a call and it was mine for &pound;995. I thought that this would be nice on my next car. Pinan in
            Japanese means Peace of mind, goes well for the Karate club.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c22"><span class="c9 c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We went to Crete one year and normally when we go on holiday we hire a moped to get
            around. Wel,l this year we thought we would upgrade to a Scooter. On a moped the brakes are on the handle
            bars. On a scooter, they are on the running board, so you have to use your feet not your hands when braking.
            We were travelling down a hill with a bus up my back-side very close</span><span class="c2">, I</span><span
            class="c9 c2">&nbsp;came to a bend and had to brake to slow down, so I used the hand brake by mistake which
            operates the front brake. I went over the top of the scooter and Pam, who was on the back, came over the top
            of me. I hit the floor first with Pam just in front, she was about two metres away from a 15 feet deep
            cliff. I got up and I went to see if she was ok, she had a nasty bump on the top of her head. People from
            the bus behind had come to look after her, I had a cut on my head and blood coming out. The people in Crete
            were very good, a man with a van said he would take us and the scooter (that was a right off) back to the
            garage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Lucky for me I had taken out full insurance so I did not have to pay anything. I
            forgot to say that as it was cold that night we had stopped to buy a jumper for Pam and a track suit for me.
            (The only colour they had was bright yellow) when we got back to our hotel, We had to go through the lounge
            with blood running down both mine and Pam&rsquo;s face. Everyone was looking at us, we went up to the room
            and got cleaned up, what a night. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We went to Palamos in Spain one year, not far from Benidorm, so we decided to drive
            to Benidorm by car. I had taken my own car on this holiday, it took about 50 minutes to get there. As we
            drove into the town, I got a puncture on my rear offside wheel so I pulled into the side of the Road. As I
            got out of the car, a man got off of his scooter and came over to talk to me, he was talking in Spanish, I
            was unable to understand him. I was more interested in getting the tyre fixed because I was parked in a red
            zone and did not want a ticket. I phoned a local garage to come out and fix the </span><span
            class="c2">tyre</span><span class="c9 c2">, it was not long before the mechanic arrived to fix it. He got
            the spare wheel from the boot and did not realise that had to have special wheel nuts because it was a
            different wheel. He broke two of the studs on the back plate of the wheel trying to use the wrong nuts.

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whilst this was going on the man on the scooter came back and started to talk, again
            in Spanish, as Pam and I were talking at the back of the car not known to us a man had opened the front of
            the car door and taken Pam&rsquo;s handbag. He didn&rsquo;t realise he was seen doing this by a lady sitting
            outside a cafe. She chased after him, hitting him over the head with her handbag. He dropped Pam&rsquo;s bag
            and ran off, the lady returned the bag to Pam who thanked her. The man who was speaking in Spanish to me
            drove off fast on his scooter. He must have been with the man who tried to take Pam&rsquo;s bag. He was
            trying to distract us. Getting back to the car that was now useless because the wheel nuts were not fitted.
            I telephoned the local Mercedes dealer who towed us back to their garage. The car could not be fixed because
            it needed a new backplate. We left the car and booked into the local hotel. We were fed up now because we
            had lost two days of our holiday. We picked the car up the next day minus &pound;800 charges and paid
            &pound;80</span><span class="c13 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c2">for the hotel. Not a very nice two
            day&rsquo;s. By the way we went back to the cafe and spoke to the lady that got our bag back and offered her
            &pound;50 to treat her children. Big mistake. She went ape, saying that she did not want money for doing the
            correct thing. We thanked her again and left. I said to Pam on the way home how brave she was, she did not
            think about getting attacked or hurt. It goes to show you, there are still a lot of good people about, but
            she shouldn&rsquo;t have chased him. She was a really nice lady. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">One year coming up to our Wedding Anniversary, &nbsp;I thought I would surprise
            Pam with a special holiday. I booked us to see the Rolling Stones in New York Shea Stadium. We arrived at
            Gatwick to catch our flight, only to find out that the airline had gone bust, so they transferred us to a
            Virgin Atlantic flight. We booked in and managed to get upgraded to first class. This was on a Jumbo Jet
            aeroplane and we went upstairs in the bubble. We got to New York and went out that night and saw a shop
            selling paintings and prints. Pam had her eye on a picture of the Flintstones, it was a cell from the actual
            film. We went in and the price was eight hundred Dollars. The sales lady said, if we come back a little
            later, Joseph Barbra and William Hanna are visiting the shop and they will sign it for you. We went back and
            sure enough they were there. They asked us where we came from in England. One of them was English and
            recognised our accent, we told them. We talked for a while and they signed the back of the painting (cell )
            for us. With good wishes on the back. Next day we went to see the Rolling Stones but only just got there in
            time. Our seats were near the front, they were great. The following day, we went on a boat trip around the
            Hudson River. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The same day we took a helicopter flight over Manhattan. We then had to go back
            because we only had four days in New York. We went back to New York a few years later and then on to see
            Niagara Falls. It was so cold that day, it was a shame because it was our Wedding Anniversary on this day.
            We went back to our hotel. After a short while we decided to go to the cinema to see The Bodyguard. The next
            day we went to Washington, this was a two week holiday, so we had more time to explore the country. One year
            when Pam had her 60th birthday. I arranged for all our family to surprise her in Los Angeles. They were
            sitting in the Hotel when we arrived, she cried her eyes out. It was brilliant. What a holiday. </span></p>

            do nothing for the rest of the day. (wrong) We had to manage the paperwork that came with the job,
            Advertising. We would spend the day walking the streets putting flyers through doors. The student had to be
            licensed (so we had to get these) Also organising Competitions, Special courses and Summer Camps. So much to
            do. I had lots of Black Belts helping me on the mat. But someone had to be at the desk at the clubs doing
            the desk work. This of course was Pam.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">It was not only me running the club, Pam would do our Art work for any leaflets.
            Pam also would be walking the streets (putting flyers through doors, that is.) She did the artwork for our

            were the first in our family to own our own house because at that time the government was giving out 100
            percent mortgages. We moved into the house in 1967 and could not wait to put our own stamp on this 3 bedroom
            semi (which had a telephone in it. Never had one of these before). Pam was eight months pregnant with Tina
            at this time so it was not long before we had to whip her up to Wanstead hospital. Tina was born. Meeting
            Tina was the best thing in the world. She was so small, she was love at first sight for myself and

            exciting, we sat in our back room, with me making tea for Pam all night. I had to look after her because she
            was pregnant with our 2nd baby. Our son David was born, (we had a friend staying with us at the time). I
            remember creeping up the stairs to have my first look at him. (In the 60s there was no way of telling the
            sex of a pre born baby, there was not a thing such as scans. So you had to wait till the baby was born
            before you knew the sex). Not bad I thought, handsome, just like his dad. This was just right, a boy and
            girl. The only problem having child birth at home, after a few days Pam decided to get up and come down
            stairs and start doing house work.This actually made her ill and the doctor made her go back to bed.

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was 1981 when we sold our house in New North Rd (&pound;29,000 not a bad profit in
            13 years). We moved to Chestnut Grove, a three bedroom Bungalow, just around the corner. We bought this for
            &pound;25,000 so we were mortgage free. We had some work done on it and this was a really good home for us.
            Close to the kids school and local shops. In 1987 we were on the move again to Thornwood in Epping. We
            received &nbsp;&pound;87,000 for Chestnut Grove and paid &pound;88,000 for this Detached bungalow. We had a
            small mortgage on this to help pay for some work we had done. It was a nice Detached three bedroom Bungalow.
            This was handy for the M11 and M25 that made it easy to get most places and easy for work. By now, the clubs
            were going really well and it was not long before we were in our next Bungalow in Holland on Sea. (We sold
            Epping for &pound;220,000) and paid (&pound;180,000) for this brand new three bed Bungalow at Holland on
            Sea. This was a good home because all the grandchildren could come and visit us by the sea. We spent a lot
            of time with our kids, and had great times, with our grandchildren. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tina and Bob got married in 1991 and had their reception in a grand hotel in
            Woodford. All the Famous Fresco photographers were at the Wedding. They went on to have four children, three
            boys and a girl. These kids are so clever, all going to University (they take after me). All three of them
            passed all their grades. James was the first one who was quite lively. I remember when he was about six
            years old dancing round a Mall in Miami with Pam he was driving her mad. He got married recently to a lovely
            girl called Saf, they are made for each other and make a lovely couple. James is magic on the guitar, so
            fast with his hands. He is a </span><span class="c2">camera man</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;on TV.
            &nbsp;Next in line is Georgia who was a child actor and has done many plays, shows, musical&rsquo;s and a
            film. She also starred in Les Mis&eacute;rables in the West End. She is now teaching at the first school she
            attended when she lived in Hainault. &nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2">(Silly teacher jokes What kind of

            computer programer is what I think he is, he is good at all media which is handy for Pam and I who are not
            too clever with technology. Pam will work on any problem for hours to solve it, most of the time she manages

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Harry is the comedian of the family, he has a funny answer to any question that
            you put to him. He plays any instrument you put in front of him. I used to go to him and he would give me
            guitar lessons and show me how to switch the amps on. Next on the Fresco list is Alfie who is a great
            drummer. He is a very happy child and is so polite. I remember him when he was only four years old he came
            to see us at Clacton, where we were living at the time. I had just bought a remote car, we all took it in
            turns to have a go. When it was his turn, he was driving it fast and he got so excited jumping up and down.
            He was the youngest of the family and I think that our time living in Clacton was good for him, we used to
            see Tina Bob and Co. quite often. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">We moved from Clacton 2009 (sold the bungalow for &pound;288,000) we moved to
            Witham into Mulberry, a Detached three bedroom Bungalow. (&pound;340,000) and had this refurbished and
            stayed in it for seven years. Then decided to move to a smaller one because Mulberry was too large. It had
            large rooms and needed a lot of looking after, so we managed to sell this for &pound;420,000. We then bought
            a smaller one for &pound;270,000 that was just down the road. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">This needed a little work on but looks great now. The reason we moved from Clacton
            was so that we could be nearer to work, the journey from Clacton was a long drive. One day we were
            travelling past Colchester on our way to work when I spotted an old kettle on the side of the road. I said
            to Pam &ldquo;look at that old kettle, do you think it works?&rdquo;, Pam laughed and said it probably does.
            The next day as I was going past the same place I said to Pam, &ldquo;I wonder if the kettle is still
            there.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; in her fed up mood. The following day I just said
            &ldquo;it&#39;s still there&rdquo;, this went on for a couple of months. I could see that it was really
            getting on her nerves, so on my way to football, when Pam was not with me I stopped where the kettle was and
            put it in the boot of the car. The next time we went past the spot the kettle was gone. I said to Pam
            &ldquo;look it&#39;s gone&rdquo;, I think she was glad because she knew that I would not mention it again.
        </span><span class="c7 c2">(Wrong)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The next time we went past the spot, I just
            pointed to the spot where it was, I didn&rsquo;t say a word. Next time I coughed. It was coming up to
            Christmas. One day when Pam was out, I got the kettle from the boot and wrapped it up for her Christmas
            present. When she opened it up on Christmas day she was in tears of laughter, after a while she then put it
            where it belonged in the dustbin. I took it out the next day and put it in the boot of the car. I put it
            back where I had got it from on the road near Colchester. When we went back to work after Christmas, we were
            coming up to the spot. I said &nbsp;&ldquo;look, the kettle is back&rdquo;, Pam laughed. I loved to see the
            look on Pam&#39;s face every time we passed that spot, the kettle stayed there through the winter. Then one
            day they cleared the road and it </span><span class="c2">was</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;gone.</span><span

            left them in the Forest in Spain. What I was going to do was to take Pam for a walk, and go past the
            slippers. Then say to her that they looked like the ones you threw away in the UK. But when we got to the
            spot where I had left them they had gone. Someone had taken them to use. When I told Pam she could not stop

            Seaside at Maldon. This is where David&#39;s mob would now come. The journey for &nbsp;David to Clacton was
            a long drive. Taking up of course the dreaded M25 about 110 miles each way. &nbsp;Dave and Liuda got married
            in Ukraine, Liuda is a great wife to Dave she is so funny, she has got a great sense of humour. They met at
            Daves firm when she came to England, as a student and decided to stay. Their first baby Max, was born whilst
            we were at Witham. Sophia came five years later. Max is a great character, at the time of writing this book
            he is thirteen years old. He is interested in technology, he helps me with my phone sometimes. He was
            staying with us in the summer and we were in the kitchen one day. I was making some tea, and I was
            struggling to open a bottle of milk. Max said to me hold the top and turn the bottom of the milk round
            grandad. This was easy, the top came off. I said to him no matter what age you are you can always learn
            something. (A thirteen year old showing an old man of eighty one and three quarters how to do it). It
            reminded me of what I was saying in the early part of the book about the child Black Belt that we had
            teaching the adult. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Max helps his dad clean his car which brought back memories of Dave washing my

            kid. Our other grandchild is Sophia. She is Eight going on eleven, a very sharp girl who is hard to wind up,
            she is another nutter in the Barrow/Fresco family. She has us laughing all the time, my nickname for her is
            scallywag. Sophia has just started to learn the Ukulele. We have called our group The Scallywags. Her on her
            Ukulele and me on my guitar. When we go to see her she always shows me the new chord that she has learnt.
            She is an up and coming singer with a terrific memory. I taught her the alphabet backwards and she picked it
            up in a couple of minutes. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Grandchild joke, I asked my Granddaughter to

            because she could take the kids to school. Before this, it was a twenty minute walk four times a day. We got
            her a Hillman Imp that was in beautiful condition. The car was good for Pam because I was not the only
            salesman in the house. Pam would go door to door cold selling Eggs, on a new Egg and Potato round she was
            forming. When she had built it up she then passed the round over to me, to add to our Green Grocery round.
            As you probably know, that&#39;s very hard to do. Pam then ventured into selling double glazing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">My son David broke down in his car one day and called me to help him sort it out. Pam
            and I arrived at this lane in Chigwell to help him, after we had a look we decided to tow him home. We fixed
            the tow rope on and I started to pull him slowly home. As we went to turn a right hand corner, we
        </span><span class="c2">realised</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;that the steering wheel had locked in because
            we had not had the ignition switched on. I was on one side of the road, and David on the other, with cars
            coming towards us. I quickly got out and stopped the traffic from running into us. It was night time and
            unless I had told the coming motorist they would have run into the tow rope. We continued to make our way
            home to Epping. As we pulled into our driveway I stopped, but David kept going right into the back of my new
            Mercedes. I think David had only been driving for a little while so we went easy on him. We stopped his
            pocket money for one week. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I must tell you this story of Dave whilst we were living at Epping. We had a plum
            tree in the back garden, and one day I saw a rat climbing up the tree to get one of the plums, it came from
            a ditch at the back of our garden. Our bungalow was at the end of the farmers field. We were stuck with
            fields all around us, so we would get mice etc come into the bungalow occasionally. Well, I had an Air Rifle
            so we would shoot these rats and have a competition who could get the most kills. One day whilst I was out
            shopping, I purchased a Plastic rat. I put it near the Plum tree and waited for David to come home from
            work. After a while I shouted &ldquo;Rat Dave near the tree&rdquo; &nbsp;Dave rushed into the kitchen to get
            the Air Rifle and kept pumping slugs into the plastic rat. He thought it was a real one. He went running up
            to look at his kill. Well, Pam and I were laughing so much, it took a few days for Dave to forgive
            me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">One year we had a firework party at Epping and we sent the plastic Rat up in a
            rocket, this was so funny. Pam&#39;s brother Lawrence went over to the farmers field and not known to us,
            took it home. Since then (1987) they have been sending it to each other every Christmas backward and
            forward.</span></p>

            the last day of the season I told a guy in front that we were not returning next season. He said to me,
            there is a man just along the row who will buy your seats from you, even though they have expired. I
            approached the guy and sold them to him for &pound;500. All I had to do was tell Tottenham that I had given
            the seats to a friend. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Car joke, I tried to sell my old car, but the buyer

            fancy taking it up again. Having not played since 1964, I did not know if I would have the time to play and
            learn it again. Pam said, you have plenty of time now that you have retired. I gave it some thought and
            decided I would give it a go and </span><span class="c2">sent away</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;for a

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I wrote a song about Pam and a couple of years later all my grandchildren got
            together because Pam had booked us in a recording studio for six hours. We recorded two of my songs. This is
            the first time that I had played with all my grandchildren together. James on lead guitar, myself on rhythm,
            Harry on Bass. Alfie on drums and Georgia singing and directing us for our timing. (Georgia used to go to
            drama school so knew how to do this). To have all the kids there for this was wonderful, thank you Pam for
            sorting it, it was one of the best days of my life. We must not forget my daughter Tina for taking the video
            of the session and Pam for walking about 1 mile on a boiling hot day to get the coffees for us. When I play
            now, I have to have the music in front of me, otherwise I forget the lyrics and chords, even to the songs
            that I have written. My face is covered by the music stand as I play, which is not a bad thing. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">People that know me would find it hard to believe that I struggle with nerves,
            when I play in front of people. Yet I would be able to teach Karate to as many as 120 students at my Summer
            Camps no problem at all. I find it a big problem when I go to the Guitar shop to buy a new guitar, I have to
            play it to see if I like it. But now, as I have gotten to know them, they let me use a small room to try the
            Guitar. I find I have started getting more confident since playing at care homes. I do this for nothing as
            it really helps the people in these homes, they don&rsquo;t have much to do. I like to entertain them, mind
            you I am not stupid you know because they can&rsquo;t hear all the mistakes I make. It&rsquo;s strange I
            call these people old, and yet I think I am older than a lot of them. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The old songs that I sing sometimes bring back memories of where they were when it
            came out. They say that this is good for people like myself who have Vascular Dementia.But some of the songs
            that I have written have a few naughty words in them, so I have had to change the words on them. Pam comes
            with me in case I get into trouble, also she is the only one that can switch the amps on. She keeps the
            ladies away from me when they throw their knickers at me. It&#39;s great playing in these homes. I said to
            one of the workers &ldquo;I am not sure if they like what I am doing&rdquo;, she said that they would be
            talking all week about the session, they love &nbsp;it. I always put 100 percent into what I do as I told
            you, in Karate, all the training I did was more than most &nbsp;people. I think I do the same with my music,
            the only thing that stops me playing more are my fingers ,they get very sore after a couple of hours.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The singer and songwriter that has inspired me most is Joe Brown, he wrote one of
            my favourite songs Picture Of You. Pam and I have seen him in concert a few times when we lived in Clacton.
            I first saw him at the Wykenham Church Hall Romford in 1960. He filled the hall. He was so good, but even
            better than this, I was about 18 when I was at my brother Bill&rsquo;s flat in Buckhurst Hill. We were just
            about to go out to the shops when a Ford Zephyr Four came rolling down the hill with Joe Brown at the wheel.
            I said to Bill &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Joe Brown&rdquo;, he was trying to get his car engine running because
            the battery was flat. He was trying to bump start the engine. We went up to him and asked if we could help
            by pushing the car at the same time that he was trying to start the engine. &ldquo;Yes please mate&rdquo; he
            said in his cockney accent. Bill said to him cheekily &ldquo;Sign this first Joe&rdquo; Bill had a Capstan
            full strength fag packet, he handed it to Joe. We pushed him until we got him going. He did not stop to
            thank us because he was frightened of stalling the engine. I wonder if Bill kept that autograph? </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next time I saw Joe he was driving a Convertible E Type Jaguar sports car. It was
            passing the garage where I was working. He had a friend in the car who I had worked with at the ballast pit,
            his name was Ginger, as they stopped at the crossroads at the Bald Hind Chigwell. I shouted &ldquo;Hi
            Ginger&rdquo; to my friend who was sitting in the passenger seat, they both looked round and Ginger gave me
            a wave. I think that Joe Brown must have been a bit disappointed that it was not him I was calling, because
            he was the Rock Star not Ginger. I saw him mouth to Ginger &ldquo;who is he?&rdquo; I found out later that
            Ginger was doing some work on Joe&rsquo;s Garden. Joe had moved from Buckhurst Hill to Chigwell, he lived in
            the Big detached house next to Grange Farm Chigwell. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Rock Star joke,
            &nbsp;What will happen if you put a rockstar&#39;s skeleton in a tumble dryer? It&#39;ll shake, rattle and
            roll )</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, as you probably read earlier I had this thing about changing cars. I am doing
            the same thing with Guitars changing and buying new ones. I started with a Fender Stratocaster that came
            from Mexico (Fender Guitars are made in four countries, that&rsquo;s USA, Mexico Japan and Korea. The USA
            Stratocaster are the best and most expensive. Mexico 2nd best and third best Japan and Korea.) &nbsp;After
            the Mexico Strat I bought a USA custom 1958 Fender Strat. (&pound;2,400) the one that Hank Marvin has. This
            was a great guitar but I got fed up with playing instrumentals and switched to Acoustic Guitars. This is
            what I play now. My latest is a new Guitar that has just come on the market, a special Taylor Mini GS
            special edition. It plays better than the Gibson I have. I have also got a full size Taylor that I use. I
            can only have three guitars because that&rsquo;s all the space I have in the room where I </span><span
            class="c2">practice</span><span class="c9 c2">. People say to me &ldquo;why three guitars when you can only
            play one at a time?&rdquo; It&#39;s because they all play different sounds for different songs. The one I
            use most is a three quarter size, which is easy to play (like Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift plays). </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I also have my Dad&rsquo;s sixty year old Mandolin that my sister Pat gave me, but
            this needs new strings on. I don&rsquo;t want to change it knowing that he was the last person to play it.
            He would play this at home and sing to us all when we were kids. He once got me told off from school, when
            he put stickers on where the notes are, on a school Violin. It was on the school violin I was learning on.
            The teacher went nuts, but I think it was probably because the teacher did not know where the notes were and
            was jealous of my dad teaching me music.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dad went out and bought me my own violin, then fixed for me to have private lessons.
            The teacher I had was a lovely old lady. Her name was Jenny, she really helped me read music, which I found
            hard to do. I remember once she made dinner for me, I must have looked although I was starving. She took me
            to see my first classical concert at Ilford Town HalI. &nbsp;I kept this up for about one year managing to
            grade to grade three of the Royal Schools of Music with 1st class. I did not continue these lessons because
            I was about to start work as a trainee Motor mechanic. I was grateful to my Dad for paying for the lessons.
            I know it must have been hard for him to get the money together for this. (I did repay this later, because I
            was able to give him &pound;40 each week to add to his pension when he retired). I think Dad was really
            proud of my music achievements, and of keeping the Karate schools going. He was in hospital once for a heart
            operation and Pam and I went to see him and he was telling the person in the next bed that I was a
            millionaire. Pam and I laughed at this, but it was sad because at the end of the visit he said that he
            wanted us to take him home. He had only just had an operation, we had to tell him that he had to stay in
            hospital a bit longer. I still miss my dad, but one thing that I will always remember was when I received my
            5th Dan Black Belt in 1992. Sensei Shinohara awarded it to me at our Summer Camp. My dad was there to see
            it. &nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">A few years ago I said to David &ldquo;how about a Spitfire Flight?&rdquo;. I had
            already flown in a Lancaster Bomber when I was in the Air Cadets. I went on a trip with them to RAF Camp
            Alder Grove in Northern Ireland. I spent a week on the RAF camp with the cadets, we did shooting with Royal
            Enfield 303. That rifle sure had a big kick in it. They told me to push it into my shoulder when you fire
            it. Back to the Lancaster, it was so noisy, all the seats were round the outside of the aircraft. We did not
            go far because the IRA were just starting to make a show at that time, it was a great holiday. I was only
            fourteen at the time. To get there, we had to travel to Liverpool and cross the Irish Sea. Now this was
            around 10pm at night. The sea was really rough and waves were coming up high up the side of the Ferry. Even
            the staff on the Ferry were sea sick. We were in third class I think, so we did not have a cabin or anywhere
            indoors to sleep, so it was very cold. I was so pleased to see the docks at Belfast. Then on a coach to
            County Antrim where the camp was. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Silly Ferry Joke &nbsp;Why does a Ferry Boat

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Dave did not need telling twice about the Spitfire trip. The next day we were
            looking as to where they fly from, the best option for us would be Goodwood. Next to the race track is an
            airfield where they have some Spitfire Trainers (these are Spitfires that have had an extra seat behind the
            pilot). Well it was not cheap, about &pound;1,800 each for twenty minutes, well you only live once. Goodwood
            here we come. First, we had to take a course in safety which is how to get out in an emergency, how to pull
            the parachute cord and a few other things. At the end of the course they explained to us not to worry
            because a Spitfire can land in a field if it has to, (this I know because one crash landed at Grange Hill
            not too far away from my last school. &nbsp;So after school we all went to look at it in the field.) </span>

            took the controls back, after a while. He then did a roll, then a loop. I could see the tower at Portsmouth
            in the distance. Then it was time to go back. Dave was telling me that his pilot slowed the plane down to 50
            miles an hour. Dave said it looked like you could get out at that slow speed. The pilot explained to him
            that it was the Spitfire that helped win the war because they could fly so slow. They could get behind enemy
            aircraft and shoot them down. Dave and myself were up in the </span><span

            to walk across the pitch to where my seats were. I did not want to get the cast wet so I put a plastic bag
            over my foot. There was about three inches of snow on the ground, so I had to drag my foot across the pitch.
            We had a good laugh over this, anyway the seats were fine. </span><span class="c6 c2">(Funny Hospital joke..

    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">These replacements that I am telling you about are due to my Arthritis. I had burnt
            myself out. &nbsp;I have two stents put in my two arteries (the stents were my own fault because of the junk
            food I would eat. Did not realise that although I was really fit and ran each day, this had nothing to do
            with being and eating healthy). I have chronic kidney disease as well. As I previously mentioned at the
            beginning, I am five years into Vascular Dementia which reduces blood flow to the brain. We are ok at the
            moment with this, it&#39;s not too bad (I say we, because Pam, who is my official carer, has to suffer with
            the problem of helping me. She does not have dementia, but has to look after me so is just as involved).
            Although we could receive payments from the government, we have decided not to. It&#39;s a horrible disease,
            I get mood swings, but I am able to control these with medication. I forget things, which is why I am
            writing this book before things get worse. Dementia is the umbrella for other diseases like
            Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Huntington&#39;s disease, Mixed Dementia and Vascular
            Dementia. I have noticed with dementia that it affects you a little bit at a time. I forget to do several
            things every day, these are mostly small things. &nbsp;For instance, yesterday, I put the used </span><span
            class="c2">teabag</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;back into the new teabags. I have started to stutter a bit
            and forget what I wanted to say. What I have to do if I am having a conversation with a few people and want
            to speak, I have to jump in quickly and say what I have to say. Sometimes having to speak over the top of
            someone, in case I forget what I was going to say. This is a small thing to everyone but these small things,
            seem to be very big, to the person with the disease. &nbsp;</span></p>

            Roding Karate Club about sparring. I would often find that it was the girls that impressed me the most, they
            are so aggressive. I had two twin girls that came to me Jenny and Lisa Skinner. They were so good, they
            would really want to win. Even when they fought each other we would often have to pull them apart. Some of
            the boys were like this as well. I can also remember a small five year old who came to me, he was so
            focused. His name was Reese Taylor he went on to become an England player. On a Summer camp at Caister we
            had the next Caravan to </span><span class="c2">his</span><span class="c9 c2">. At 6am I could &nbsp;hear
            him walking up and down his caravan making so much noise. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was
            practising his Kata. I can remember I had two young Black Belts training with me at Clacton, Michell Thorpe
            and Conor Hewitt. Conor had come to the club because he wanted to learn how to fight and did not like any
            confrontation. Michell also came to learn how to fight, they were sparring and Michell lost his temper and
            rushed in to try and hit Conner. Well Conner just moved out of the way and blocked Michell Thorpe&rsquo;s

            called the parents over, and I explained to them that although they should not have done this, it did show
            that the years of training made it so that Michell was good at attacking and Conner could now get out of the
            way of an attack. Karate had ruffed these two kids to be more confident and could now hold their own on the

            to do, she moved back as if I was going to hit her and covered her face. I asked her why she did this, she
            did not answer me, so I thought to myself that the child may have been bullied at home. I asked her this,
            she would not answer.</span></p>

            tell the parent at this stage in case there was nothing in it. But I checked on her from time to time. It

            lesson (I must point out first of all, that all students that become 1st Dan Black Belts no longer have to
            pay tuition fees at the Roding Karate Club, In case you may think that the Black Belts&#39; time helping is
            making their lesson short.) I sometimes have students help me teach, I believe that this makes the Black
            belt more confident in engaging with people inside and outside the club. I would get a junior Black Belt and
            ask him if he would help me show an adult that was having problems with learning a move (This would normally
            be in Kata practice.) If I had a full class and spare space on the Do-Jo I would get the Junior to show
            parts of a Kata that the adult is struggling with and then help them with it. I have adults do the same,
            whilst they are doing this I can tell who has the ability with more practice to become an Instructor.

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I found that a lot of students would like to run a Karate club for me, then
            eventually themselves. The first thing the Instructor has to do is a risk assessment of the training area,
            making sure that the floor of the Do-Jo is clean. Then next was to make sure the floor is sprung (if in a
            church hall or community centre). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The Instructor must have a Licence and full insurance. When the instructor enters
            the Do-Jo they should check the students licence, without this, the student will have no insurance. Next,
            make sure that the student has a Gi (Karate suit) or track suit to begin with. That their feet are clean (I
            once had to tell a young student to go and wash his feet before he starts the lesson). Then you must explain
            to the class the club rules. The best way to teach is to try and keep all the students at the same level of
            grade. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">This makes teaching very easy. Obviously some students will progress faster than
            others so they would have to join the next class. Some people will think that this is an impossible task
            because you may end up with only a few in the class, well this is where you have to advertise for new
            students all the time to keep the class full. When I was teaching, I would put enough funds aside to
            advertise the club once a month. (I had one instructor open a club on his own and put out two thousand
            flyers for an area of twenty thousand people. He had one beginner arrive over three weeks). If I was in his
            club I would have put out ten thousand flyers. You would then have an average of ten people arrive for the
            lesson.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">The kids would normally tell their friends they were going to start and then
            that&#39;s another beginner coming to the club. Nowadays there is social media to advertise on so this could
            be a good way to get to people. I used to show demonstrations and attend demo&rsquo;s at schools and
            community centres. But most of all you must keep the young student interested in what they are doing. You do
            this by playing games in the club. (They call it games, but I call it exercise). I never had a good memory
            for names, so what I found out is that if I gave the young child a nickname myself, I could then remember
            it. For instance, a young child I had at my Clacton club kept putting the wrong leg in front whilst doing
            line work. So I would call him Wrong leg, that was his name and by calling him this, made him think harder
            at what he was doing, and solving the problem. I was sitting next to Pam at the club when a child came in, I
            asked Pam her name. Pam told me and I said hello and called her by her name. After she had paid her Do-Jo
            fees, the child walked off and I heard her say to her mum. &ldquo;He just called me by my name mum.
            &#39;&#39; She felt special and was so proud.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;From that day on I made it a point to try to remember all the kids&#39;
            names. I would explain to the future instructor how to pick up mistakes that the student was making.
            Sometimes I would run a lesson, have every student give commands and pick out all the mistakes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">I would put a few would-be instructors in the line up making deliberate mistakes,
            to see if they are picked up by the instructor. This would cause a laugh from time to time. I always
            encouraged parents to stay and watch their child train. Then after a few times the parent would say to
            themselves, if I am bringing my child to the class. I might as well join in the class, (this happens a lot
            and sometimes the child would stop training and the parent kept on training). </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I would explain to the Instructor that if you had a difficult child you were teaching
            acting the fool, you must try to stop this asap because it can distract the whole class. I found out that
            the more you tell a child to stop misbehaving the more they will do it to get attention from other students.
            It was not until after a few years of teaching I </span><span class="c2">realised</span><span
            class="c2">&nbsp;the best way round the problem, I would work the yellow card system like they have in
            football. That is two cards then you don&rsquo;t come back to the club the following week for training. If
            you stick to this it will work, you must show from the off that you have control of the lesson. It is
            important to remember that it&rsquo;s not what you teach, it&#39;s how you teach that matters. You have to
            make the lesson fun if you&#39;re teaching kids. Pam and I watched an instructor in the States teaching. He
            was making the kids in the class kick a front kick for about 20 minutes. Well you could see on the
            kid&rsquo;s faces that their mind was thinking of what they were going to do later that evening and not on
            the front kick that they were doing. Watching this, I felt like going to </span><span class="c2">sleep at
            the time myself</span><span class="c9 c2">. This instructor had about ten in his class, which went on for
            about two hours long. It&rsquo;s important that students leave the lesson wanting more. Sometimes when I
            have stopped the class to go home, I have heard kid&rsquo;s moaning that they want more. One hour is long
            enough for the average child&rsquo;s attention span, more than this they normally get bored. (Not the smart
            kids, I would let them do the next class as well).</span></p>

            class="c6 c2">&nbsp;</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">These are the famous and semi famous people that I have met during my life. The first
            is an old now passed actor Arthur Mullard who would play in comedy films with Norman Wisdom and he was also
            in the Carry On films. He owned and lived in 84 Hornsey Road North London, where we lived from 1945 to 1947.
            &nbsp;From What&#39;s my Line &hellip;Angela Rippon. Ruth Madox. Ted Rogers. Simon Williams. Jilly Cooper.
            From Tomorrow&#39;s World, Kieth Chegwin. Maggie Philbin. Judith Hann. Mike Hugg. (Manfred Mann). I also met
            and had a chat with one of the hardest villains in Great Britain, Roy Shaw. When he shook my hand he nearly
            broke it, so much strength. He was well known for his bare knuckle fight with Lenny McLean, he was a Krays
            henchman at some stage, he </span><span class="c2">passed</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;in 1998. Bobby
            Moore would come into my garage from time to time. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">My future wife Pam and I were driving along Fencepiece Road in Barkingside when I
            spotted Bobby Moore&#39;s Jaguar in front of us. I said, &lsquo;Pam, that&rsquo;s Bobby Moore in
            front&rsquo;. She said, &lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;I will overtake him, you look and see if it
            is as we get level&rsquo;. Pam looked at him and he smiled to her, but when I wanted to get past, he would
            not let me overtake. Now, the car I was driving was a Ford 100E Popular </span><span class="c7 c2">(Roland
            Rat car)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and this could only do about 50 miles an hour. He then laughed and
            pulled away at fast speed. Both Pam and myself were in stitches. I felt such a fool. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I also went to a private concert (with about 100 other people, for rehearsal ) with
            my daughter Tina. We saw Paul and Linda McCartney. &nbsp;The concert was in London and outside he signed
            autographs. Had a cheek to use Tina&rsquo;s pen, but returned it to her with a smile. </span><span

            Karate</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have met some really nice people during my Karate Journey. I must say that My son
            in law Bob 6th Dan, who now runs the Roding Karate Club, has been loyal throughout since joining the club in
            1978. He has helped me a lot, he would teach at many clubs for me. He would also find training halls for the
            club. Next has to be my brother Pete for helping me run the Karate shop, also for teaching at clubs
            throughout Essex and Hertfordshire. He was a great help at Summer Camps that we would do. He also would sort
            out new clubs for us, and make trophies for the club. Next must be retired Karate teacher Dean Ince 6th Dan,
            he mainly taught fighting at the clubs and Summer Camps. I first taught Dean when he came to the club with
            his brother Ricky in 1982. ( His father is Dave Ince, who I would get up to mischief with along with my
            brother Bill when we were at school). Dean started to </span><span class="c2">teach for me</span><span
            class="c9 c2">&nbsp;a few years later. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">Then we have Steven Brame, 5th Dan, who would teach Kata for me at his club. He
            started training with Bob in the early 90s. He has been a great help for the club. Steve still teaches at
            Harold Hill. We then have Greg Wallace 5th Dan he would spend hours with students on the competition
            circuit. Nearly every week he would take a squad up and down the country competing. He would help me at
            Dagenham and now runs the club at Dagenham. &nbsp;I must also give big thanks to all the other Instructors
            that have helped over the years. Far too many to list. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c9 c2">But most of all I would like to thank my partner, the man that helped us start the
            club back in the day. That is my good friend 7th Dan, Ian Cuthbert. We started the club together back in
            1976. We both loved teaching. When I wanted someone to help me start the club, he was the best man to pick.
            Ian now runs Tai Chi classes and he has his two children Luke and Daniel help run his UKA Karate Schools.
            Ian worked hard on getting the best out of the students. He became friends with the brother in law of my
            Instructor Alf Pitkin. That was Carl Dyer and I worked with him for a few years. Carl was good for Ian to
            fight with being a younger partner and feel They both learned a lot from each other.</span></p>

            life Pam who has helped year after year when we were teaching and running the administration side of the
            club. Pam&#39;s help was so good. When new students had a problem they would go to Pam who would sort it
            out. Pam would take the filming and reproduce videos of the summer camps. She would spend hours doing this.
            (I would like to point out though, that she did &nbsp;get &pound;1 an hour and free dinners for helping).

            believe it was Dymchurch near Folkestone Kent &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Roding karate Club started teaching at this camp twice a year from 1984-1992. We
            then moved the Camps to Clacton Great Yarmouth / Caister then one at Camber Sands. Then Kessingland near
            Great Yarmouth. These camps were a great success all those years, producing lots of great Karate students. I
            can&rsquo;t remember all the students&#39; names unfortunately. I notice in the front row young Reece
            Taylor, England Kata Champion and also England players Steve Brame and Greg Wallace. At these camps the
            students would train in the morning. Starting with a two mile run along the seafront. I can remember one
            year when some of the students tried to get me drunk by buying me drinks all night. Although they nearly
            succeeded I still managed to get to the Do-Jo the next day although I felt a bit under the weather. I still
            took them on the normal run. But instead of going into the Do-Jo I made them go into the sea (and myself) up
            to their waist and </span><span class="c2">practiced</span><span class="c9 c2">&nbsp;punching techniques.
            They never tried to get me drunk again. It was at these camps that we would hold our Black Belt Dan
            gradings, with all the parents and other students that were not grading watching. We would have a big party
            on the last day of the holiday to celebrate those that passed their grade.</span></p>
