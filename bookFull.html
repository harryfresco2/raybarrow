        <h2>Preface.</h2>
        <p2>
            I decided to write this journal today as in 2018 I was diagnosed with Vascular Dementia. 
            This is short term memory loss. I can remember most of the past, but I forget what has happened the day before.
             Things like films I can not remember at all, so often I would be watching a film and Pam would tell me that I had seen the film before. 
             I would have no knowledge of this, also I can get half way through a sentence and forget what I am talking about. <br><br>I am unable to read books because as soon as I get to the end of a chapter, I forget the contents that I have just read. This gets frustrating for both myself and Pam, so I am writing this whilst I am able to. I can tell you this, that all that I am writing is the truth, the whole truth, so help me God. This is written in words that I use myself. There are no substitute words. The punctuation has not been changed, most of the spelling has been checked with the spellcheck on the Mac, the grammar is how it is, so as you read this you may have a good laugh at the way its written. <br><br>You may find that some dates are mixed about a bit, some times of events in the article should be in different places, all the photos are listed in the last page. I hope this is interesting. Itâ€™s a bit about my life, any dodgy stuff has been left out (if there was any).
