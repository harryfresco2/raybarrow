        <h2>Meeting my Mum & Dad.</h2>
        <p2>
            I first met my mum in 1942. I was born in a top floor apartment, in Kier Hardy House, Hazellville Road, a large block of flats at the top of Crouch End Road, North London. This is where we lived with three elder brothers and one younger sister who was born in Liverpool. John was the older out of us all. He was born in 1936, next came Fred 1938 and Bill 1939 (they were born in Blundell St, North London). My Dad was a professional soldier in the Army. He was in the Royal Fusiliers. Then, because of his Railway knowledge, was transferred to the Royal Engineers. He worked on the railways in France and Germany in the 2nd World War. I can only remember one thing whilst we lived there, that is when I was about three years old, my mum took me outside to see what she said were fireworks. They were, in fact, the bombs being dropped on London. As we lived at the top of the block of flats we had a view of the whole of London being bombed, I could see houses and buildings on fire, I can still remember it today. Silly war joke (If women  ruled the world there would be no war, just a bunch of countries not talking to each other). 
It was about 1946 that we moved to 84 Hornsey Road, North London. I was four years old, we lived in a three story house that was owned by a film star. His name was Arthur Mullard. He had the first two floors and we had the top floor and the attic. The toilet was down stairs in the garden. I can remember sleeping in the attic with lots of coats on the bed for blankets. We had the water tank up there and my dad put fish inside the tank. I remember him saying to me that they keep the water clean for us to drink. It was in 84 Hornsey Rd my younger brother was born. His name was Jimmy. I remember that sometimes mum would let me feed him, holding the bottle. In 1947 he died of Whooping Cough, he was only 18 months old. In those days, of course, there was no NHS. That did not start ‘til 1948 I can remember in the end of our back garden of 84 were railway lines, and trains would come by with American soldier’s on it, and as I was only about four they would throw money for me. This was probably my first venture into business because I would go out most days to catch the coins, then give them to my mum who would buy cakes for us. 
We had lot’s of fun in those days, I would play on the railway lines with my brothers, we would play on the bomb sites, and go scrumping. I can remember we would bunk in cinemas (go in the back door that was left open most days), then have the cheek to go up into the balcony and pick the best seats. I think that the manager knew what we were doing and turned a blind eye to us. At least it was warm in there for a few hours, we did not have any heating in our house, or hot running water. This had to be boiled in a kettle. We would go to the swimming baths to wash and bathe, not far from 84. 
We would leave the house at 9am and would go back when we were hungry. All day, most days, we found some new interest. I remember one day we were over Clissold Park and Fred was down in a bomb site, and an old bedstead fell on him. Bill and myself managed to lift it up, so he was ok. I started school when I was five and can remember that the teacher would make us stand in line and she would give every child a teaspoon of malt. She gave a spoonful to one child, then put the spoon in the jar and fed the next one without washing the spoon. As you are aware, there was not too much hygiene in those days. We were very poor in those days and did not have much in the way of clothes. I would get the ones that my brothers had grown out of. Some had holes in them, so at the school the teacher took me to the stock room and sorted out some clothes for me to wear and told me that I should only wear these at school. (Silly School Joke: Why did the teacher wear sunglasses to school? Because her students were so bright).
