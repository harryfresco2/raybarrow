        <h2>Dad coming home</h2>
        <p2>
            I can remember that my dad came home from the Army one day, and said that he will be home to stay now because he had resigned from the army. He did this knowing that he was only just a few weeks away from getting his pension. He was a Sergeant and one story he told us was when he led a small platoon onto the beach, whilst he was at Dunkirk. It was here that the Germans were bombing. One of his group had gone AWOL and Dad had to go back and get him. Whilst he was looking for him, his whole platoon had been killed by a German bomb. How lucky was he?<br><br>
I was very proud of my dad. He could make and build anything. He took a motorbike engine to bits and put it all back with new parts, without an instruction book. When we were at Hainault, he taught me how to do woodwork and lots of different things that a handyman can do. Sadly, I was not very good at this, and later in life Pam is the person that does most of this at our home. He brought a Grandfather clock home from Germany. It was all in pieces in his kit bag, then he assembled it and that stayed in the hall in our new home to be, in Hainault.  <br><br>
My mum managed to feed us all with only a small amount of money coming in. Dad managed to get a job as a railway engineer at Acton, North West London. He later got a transfer to Hainault, Essex Depot.<br><br><em> (Silly Dad joke: Why do fathers take an extra pair of socks when they go golfing? In case they get a hole in one!)</em><br>
